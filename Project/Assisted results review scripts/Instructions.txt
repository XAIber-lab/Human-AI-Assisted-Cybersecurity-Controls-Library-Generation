Open the file "launcher.py" in python.
Select the required analysis type. This will make the launcher use the right python script, indicated by the name between ().
Browse the CSV file or files.
The default output folder will be located in the same folder of the launcher, unless a different location is selected. 
Run the analysis. The results will be presented in a generated HTML, which will open automatically at the end of the analisys.

Note:
The launcher and the two scripts (Results.py and Match.py) need to be in the same folder.
The output filename of the single analysis follows the format "inputFilename results.html"
The output filename of the double analysis follows the format "firstFilename secondFilename match.html"
Please notice that a second analysis of the same csv file or files will override the precedent one.
