"There are still some questions to be answered. Notably, the Interim Measures also state that there may be further classified and graded regulations applicable to generative AI services";red
"Some of the aspects within the Interim Measures will likely be developed – such as copyright status/protection of any materials arising from generative AI, how and the extent to which algorithms are to be disclosed, and how phrases such as "support the public opinion or mobilize the public" will be interpreted";yellow
"The Interim Measures also represent a new addition to China's regulatory framework for data";red
