With the second edition of the German Standardization Roadmap Artificial Intelligence, today we are able to present an expanded and updated analysis of the current status and need for international standards and specifications for this key technology_GV.PO-01_GV.PO-02_ID.IM-01_Low_definition
Standards play an important role in the planned AI Act. They serve to reliably implement the requirements of the AI Act and help make the development of AI systems more efficient and reliable_GV.OC-03_GV.PO-01_PR.PS-06_Medium_definition
The quality and speed of European standardization work depends on the substantive groundwork carried out at national level_GV.PO-01_GV.RR-02_GV.OC-02_Low_definition
In absence of available harmonized standards, common specifications may take their place which is seen as disadvantageous in comparison with the principle of standardization_GV.PO-01_GV.PO-02_GV.OC-03_Low_definition
Through such standards, the approval processes can be implemented faster, more reliably and more uniformly_GV.RM-06_GV.PO-01_ID.RA-06_Low_definition
Standards and specifications for the dynamic type approval of mobility systems whose functionality is based at least in part on the use of AI technology are therefore urgently needed in order to enable or guarantee sufficient performance on a sustained basis under these complex boundary conditions_ID.AM-08; PR.PS-06_GV.PO-01_PR.IR-03_High_
Standards and specifications for minimum requirements (in particular, intolerable residual risks to safety) as well as the other essential trust aspects (including IT security, robustness, transparency, traceability, data protection and non-discrimination) must be defined and taken into account over the entire life cycle of an AI system_ID.RA-05; PR.DS-01_PR.PS-06_ID.AM-08_High_data protection; transparency
The evidence and validations of trustworthiness and security to an independent third party are enabled_ID.RA-09_GV.OV-03_RS.AN-06_Medium_
The requirement to carry out a conformity assessment procedure, applies both to safety components of products and to AI systems that constitute stand-alone products_ID.AM-08; ID.RA-09_GV.PO-01_PR.PS-06_High_
These include requirements in the areas of risk management, data and data governance, technical documentation, record-keeping requirements, transparency, human oversight, and accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity_GV.RM-01; PR.DS-01_ID.AM-07_GV.RR-02_High_transparency
In addition, providers of high-risk systems must implement other obligations such as the establishment of a quality management system, registration obligations, post-market monitoring measures, and reporting of serious incidents and malfunctions_DE.CM-09; RS.CO-02_RS.CO-03_ID.IM-03_High_
Furthermore, high-risk AI systems as in Annex 3 must be registered in a publicly accessible European database for market access. Post-market monitoring must be designed to actively and systematically collect, document, and analyze data on the performance of high-risk AI systems over their lifetime_DE.CM-09; DE.AE-02_ID.AM-02_RS.AN-07_High_
If the inspection is positive, the notified body issues an EU certificate on the assessment of the technical documentation. Any change to the AI system that could affect its conformity with the requirements or its intended purpose requires the approval of the notified body_ID.RA-07_GV.OV-03_RS.AN-06_High_
Overall, the risk management system and also human oversight must be implemented to accompany the AI system throughout its life cycle_GV.RM-01; GV.RR-01_ID.AM-08_PR.AT-01_High_
Furthermore, there must be a digital tracking of the functionality_DE.CM-09_PR.PS-04_ID.AM-08_High_
From a technical regulation perspective, the functionality of AI systems is supervised as part of post-market surveillance by national supervisory authorities in the individual European member states_DE.CM-09_GV.OV-03_RS.CO-02_Medium_
As part of the conformity assessment process, manufacturers of high-risk AI applications should ensure or demonstrate that their products meet, in particular, the requirements for AI systems listed in Title III, Chapter 2_ID.RA-09; GV.PO-01_ID.AM-08_PR.PS-06_High_
Establish data infrastructures and elaborate data quality standards for the development and validation of AI systems_PR.DS-01; ID.AM-07_PR.PS-06_ID.RA-09_High_
Tools: Across the life cycle of an AI system, humans need to be supported with processes, methods, and tools â€“ from goal setting to development to operation with iterations and re-validation_PR.AT-01; PR.AT-02_ID.AM-08_GV.RR-02_High_
Consider humans as part of the system in all phases of the AI life cycle_PR.AT-01_GV.RR-02_PR.AT-02_High_
To enable the successive deployment of secure and trustworthy AI-based mobility applications despite remaining and emerging uncertainties, agile approaches to regulation and standardization are needed to enable continuous monitoring and adjustment of the effectiveness of regulatory levers_GV.PO-02; DE.CM-09_ID.RA-07_GV.RM-06_High_
This requires monitoring of operational risk factors and presupposes certain societal expectations, as well as a close integration of standardization and regulation_DE.CM-09_GV.RM-05_ID.RA-05_Medium_
Developing a methodology to assess the runtime, accuracy, and sustainability performance of AI and ML systems_ID.AM-08; PR.PS-06_DE.CM-09_ID.RA-09_High_
By specifying technical and compatibility requirements for products, services or processes, but also by defining terms or interfaces, interoperability is ensured and the protection of people, the environment and things is ensured_ID.AM-08; PR.PS-01_GV.PO-01_PR.PS-06_Medium_
