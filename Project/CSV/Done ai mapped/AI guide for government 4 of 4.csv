1_Monitor model output: Monitor the model as it processes this live data to ensure that it is adequately able to produce the intended outcome—a process known as generalization, or the model's ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data In production, models can "drift," meaning that the performance will change over time Careful monitoring of drift is important and may require continuous updating of the model_DE.CM-09; DE.AE-02_DE.CM-01_DE.AE-04__High_

4_Interview users for an AI project Too often, leadership, program managers, and algorithm developers create solutions for problems that don't exist, or solutions that are simply not aligned on the right problem By interviewing an application's actual users, AI practitioners and implementers can understand the needs and intricacies of the exact audience they're working to help_GV.OC-02_PR.AT-01_GV.RR-01__High_

6_Once you've completed a successful pilot, look to evaluate its effectiveness towards your objectives If you determine that the pilot proved enough value—with clearly defined and quantified KPIs—that your agency wants a longer term solution, then you should seek to move the pilot to production_ID.IM-01_GV.OV-03___High_
6_The requirements must feature the ways in which the results from the model will be evaluated, used, and updated_GV.RM-06_PR.PS-06___High_
7_Project ownership - What part of the organization will assume responsibility for the product's daily continuation?GV.RR-02_GV.RR-01___High
7_Implementation plan - Since the pilot addressed only a small part of the overarching problems, how will you roll out the solution to the whole organization?GV.PO-01_ID.IM-03___High
7_Sunset evaluations - At what point will the organization no longer need the results coming from the AI solution? Who and how will this be evaluated?GV.OV-01_GV.OV-03___High
7_Survey the workforce to find this talent in-house to begin building AI institutional capability_GV.RR-04_PR.AT-02___Medium_
7_To complement government personnel, consider bringing in contractor AI talent and/or AI products and services_GV.RR-03_GV.SC-02___Medium_
7_For early teams, focus on bringing in contractors with a clear mandate to train government personnel or provide infrastructure services when the AI support element has not yet been stood up_PR.AT-02_GV.SC-02___High_
9_Infrastructure as code (IaC) brings the repeatability, transparency, and testing of modern software development to the management of infrastructure such as networks, load balancers, virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and monitoring_PR.PS-01_PR.IR-01__transparency_Medium_definition
9_IaC defines what the end state of your infrastructure needs to be, then builds the resources necessary to achieve and self-heal Using infrastructure as code also helps standardize cluster configuration and manage add-ons like network policy, maintenance windows, and Identity and Access Management (IAM) for cluster nodes and workloads_PR.PS-01_PR.AA-01_PR.IR-01__High_
10_Include technical tests in your solicitation as evaluation criteria These tests should allow your technical subject-matter experts on your evaluation panel to verify the ability of any suggested approaches to apply to your program's specific circumstances_GV.SC-06_ID.RA-09___High_
10_These assessments include defining requirements and metrics by talking with various stakeholders, designing experiments and tests, and doing analysis and making actionable recommendations to the leadership on overall system performance across its operational envelope_ID.IM-02_GV.OV-03___High_
11_Traditional systems usually undergo two distinct stages of test and evaluation First is developmental test and evaluation (DT&E), which verifies that a system meets technical performance specifications DT&E often uses models, simulations, test beds, and prototypes to test components and subsystems, hardware and software integration, and production qualification_ID.IM-02_PR.PS-06___High_definition
11_At this stage, the system is usually tested under realistic operational conditions and with the operator This is where we learn about the system's mission effectiveness, suitability, and survivability_ID.IM-02_PR.PS-06___High_
11_What is the model's computing burden on the system? Is this burden acceptable?PR.IR-04_PR.PS-06___Medium

11_Ethical T&E - Depending on the AI solution's purpose, this step ensures the system does only what it's supposed to do and doesn't do what it's not supposed to do_GV.RR-01_ID.RA-01___High_
12_Data rights and intellectual property clauses aren't the only ways to ensure a project can move from one team to another Deliverables like product backlogs and open source repositories with the complete source code and all necessary artifacts are essential for creating technical and process-agnostic solutions_GV.SC-10_PR.PS-06___High_
13_Use retrospectives on the acquisition process to identify key clauses and language that worked and language that caused problems, both in terms of the solicitation and post-award management Lessons learned should be standardized through documentation that will allow new and inexperienced members of the team to ramp up quickly_ID.IM-01_GV.SC-09___High_
