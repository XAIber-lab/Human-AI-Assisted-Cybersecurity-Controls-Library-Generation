4_The central question underlying the development and spread of AI is that of the ethical dimension. The widespread use and management of data through the application of algorithms and autonomous systems has multiple ethical and moral implications. In consequence, appropriate processes and control mechanisms must be employed to protect our values, principles and rights_GV.OV-01; GV.OV-02_GV.RM-01_ID.RA-05_privacy_High_Definition
4_Among other initiatives, the present Strategy includes the development of a Digital Rights Charter and the creation of mechanisms to supervise the ethics of AI, in order to facilitate consensus on a suitable framework for this technological development_GV.PO-01; GV.PO-02_GV.OV-01__transparency_High_
9_Promote the creation of data stores and facilitate access to them_PR.DS-01; PR.DS-02_ID.AM-07__data protection_Medium_
12_White Paper on Artificial Intelligence. Emphasises the need to strengthen industrial and technological capacities, with appropriate regulatory changes, coordination and governance, to ensure these capacities are expanded in an ethical, reliable way, in line with EU standards. The corresponding security and civil liability framework must also be constructed_GV.OC-03_GV.PO-01_GV.RR-01_transparency_High_
12_European policy document 'Artificial Intelligence': Proposes a development framework to address technological, security, protection, ethical, inclusion, legal and socio-economic issues, with the ultimate aim of promoting research and industrial capacity to make AI widely available_GV.OC-01; GV.OC-02_GV.RM-01_GV.PO-01__Medium_Definition
12_This framework focuses on the socio-economic changes arising from the use and implementation of AI, on the EU's coordination of research and initiatives in this field, on the creation and development of specialised talent and on guaranteeing protection for the population and the provisions of the welfare state, focusing on the population's needs and on bolstering confidence in AI_GV.RM-01; GV.RM-02_GV.RR-02_GV.OC-02_transparency_Medium_
16_The Strategy also addresses the need to design systems that are robust, secure and impartial, with AI applications that are reliable, explainable, transparent and inclusive. In addition, they must comply with fundamental rights and applicable regulations, respect basic principles and values, and take into account the collective aspirations of the population_GV.RM-01; GV.RM-02_PR.PS-01_GV.OC-03_transparency_High_
18_Digitalisation, access to large volumes of data, the development of general purpose AI platforms incorporating resources (data, corpora, lexicons, ontologies, models, etc.), algorithms and inference engines, together with supercomputing infrastructure or other high-performance, high-processing capacity mechanisms: all of these elements are essential for the development of AI, for its use and promotion by government administrations and for its low or zero-cost availability to innovative SMEs and researchers_ID.AM-02; ID.AM-08_PR.DS-01_PR.IR-04_data protection_Medium_Definition
18_Beyond investing in the generation of new data sets and data infrastructures, the efficient management and governance of data use must also be ensured, in accordance with principles of interoperability, integrity, reliability, quality and legality. At the same time, citizens' rights, privacy and confidentiality must be protected, as called for by European initiatives such as the European Open Source Cloud and by Spanish legislation on data protection_PR.DS-01; PR.DS-02_GV.OC-03_ID.RA-06_privacy; data protection_High_
19_The development and deployment of AI has great potential and raises expectations, but it may also create uncertainty due to its ethical, legal, social and economic implications. If Spain is to place itself at the political and social forefront of this technological revolution, an appropriate framework for action must be created. Moreover, we must consider whether the current rules and standards for coexistence will continue to be appropriate, whether the ethical and legal framework that has served us to date will still be sufficient, and what adjustments may be needed to protect individuals in a digital world_GV.RM-01; GV.RM-02_ID.RA-04_GV.OC-03_transparency_High_
19_In all of these respects, ethical and democratic ideals must prevail over the development of AI. Furthermore, the action framework arising from these considerations will be complementary to the corresponding social and political debate and to the regulatory procedures that will be required for each case_GV.PO-01; GV.PO-02_GV.OC-03_GV.RM-01_transparency_High_
20_Digital literacy is the ability to locate, organise, understand, evaluate and analyse information using digital technology. Accordingly, it goes beyond merely learning to use the tools_PR.AT-01_PR.AT-02__transparency_Low_Definition
20_Understanding the benefits of digital technology, accessing it, and using it to communicate, and perhaps even creating digital content; these are some of the skills that must be much more widely acquired to narrow the digital divide_PR.AT-01; PR.AT-02_GV.RR-04___Low_
27_DIHs are key elements for knowledge transfer, supporting the digital transformation and enabling the effective uptake of AI by public administrations, businesses (especially SMEs) and industry, facilitating access to knowledge, IT skills, cloud platforms, and testing, training and service facilities_PR.AT-01; PR.AT-02_ID.IM-01_GV.SC-02__Medium_Definition
23_To generate an optimal environment and to establish mechanisms that will enhance innovative capabilities in AI, both in the public and in the private sector, the Strategy proposes the following five objectives for research and technological development_GV.RM-01_ID.IM-01_GV.SC-01__Medium_
23_Create platforms for research cooperation and for the transfer of results between the public and private sectors. Furthermore, attract and retain research talent in Spain, reducing paperwork and processing times that would otherwise hamper this process. Foster the creation of public-private consortia for research projects, encouraging the participation of SMEs and startups in the sector in order to create a solid, expanding AI ecosystem in the country, underpinning the productive fabric_GV.SC-01; GV.SC-02_ID.IM-01_GV.RR-03__Medium_
19_The relationship between AI and government administration is one of mutual benefit. On the one hand, AI heightens transparency and facilitates the communication of public activity in sectors such as health care, social services, the environment, energy, justice, transport, logistics, education, employment and security. At the same time, it provides a more accurate picture of our society and makes it possible to determine priorities for action, identifying areas with competitive advantages and those which are most disadvantaged_GV.OC-01; GV.OC-02_GV.RM-01___Medium_Definition
19_In turn, government activities foster the acceptance and use of AI by providing finance and promotion and by integrating AI into the administrative process. In the final instance, it is society at large that benefits from the introduction and application of AI, and so the citizenry should monitor government activities, exploit the proximity achieved and make use of AI applications that respond to individual circumstances_GV.RR-01; GV.RR-02_GV.OC-02_GV.RM-01_transparency_Medium_
28_This ecosystem for the transfer and implementation of research findings is expected to foster the creation of new projects, startups or spinoffs from research centres, university research groups, public research bodies and university and non-university research institutes, providing co-financing and stabilisation assistance. Cooperation between spinoffs, SMEs, large companies, research centres and universities will also be promoted, to favour the transfer of existing knowledge, to create new lines and products of research and to stabilise the personnel specialised in R&D&I, in different environments and sectors_GV.SC-01; GV.SC-02_ID.IM-01_GV.RR-03__Medium_
