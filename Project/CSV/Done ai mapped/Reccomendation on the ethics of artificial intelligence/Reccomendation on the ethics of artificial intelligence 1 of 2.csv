20_"The choice to use AI systems and which AI method to use should be justified in the following ways: (a) the AI method chosen should be appropriate and proportional to achieve a given legitimate aim; (b) the AI method chosen should not infringe upon the foundational values captured in this document, in particular, its use must not violate or abuse human rights; and (c) the AI method should be appropriate to the context and should be based on rigorous scientific foundations."_GV.OC-01; GV.RM-01_GV.PO-01_GV.OV-03__high
20_"Unwanted harms (safety risks), as well as vulnerabilities to attack (security risks) should be avoided and should be addressed, prevented and eliminated throughout the life cycle of AI systems to ensure human, environmental and ecosystem safety and security. Safe and secure AI will be enabled by the development of sustainable, privacy-protective data access frameworks that foster better training and validation of AI models utilizing quality data."_ID.RA-05; ID.RA-06_PR.DS-01_GV.SC-07_privacy_high
31_"The continuous assessment of the human, social, cultural, economic and environmental impact of AI technologies should therefore be carried out with full cognizance of the implications of AI technologies for sustainability"_ID.RA-04; ID.RA-05_GV.OV-03_GV.SC-07__high
32_"Privacy, a right essential to the protection of human dignity, human autonomy and human agency, must be respected, protected and promoted throughout the life cycle of AI systems. It is important that data for AI systems be collected, used, shared, archived and deleted in ways that are consistent with international law"_PR.DS-01; PR.DS-02_GV.OC-03_GV.PO-01_privacy_high
33_"Adequate data protection frameworks and governance mechanisms should be established in a multi-stakeholder approach at the national or international level, protected by judicial systems, and ensured throughout the life cycle of AI systems."_GV.PO-01; GV.PO-02_PR.DS-01_GV.OC-03_data protection_high
33-34_"Data protection frameworks and any related mechanisms should take reference from international data protection principles and standards concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personal data and exercise of their rights by data subjects while ensuring a legitimate aim and a valid legal basis for the processing of personal data, including informed consent."_GV.OC-03; PR.DS-01_GV.PO-01_GV.SC-05_data protection; privacy_high
34_"Algorithmic systems require adequate privacy impact assessments, which also include societal and ethical considerations of their use and an innovative use of the privacy by design approach. AI actors need to ensure that they are accountable for the design and implementation of AI systems in such a way as to ensure that personal information is protected throughout the life cycle of the AI system."_ID.RA-04; ID.RA-05_PR.DS-01_GV.RR-02_privacy_high
35_"Member States should ensure that it is always possible to attribute ethical and legal responsibility for any stage of the life cycle of AI systems, as well as in cases of remedy related to AI systems, to physical persons or to existing legal entities."_GV.RR-01; GV.RR-02_GV.OC-03_GV.PO-01__high
37_"The transparency and explainability of AI systems are often essential preconditions to ensure the respect, protection and promotion of human rights, fundamental freedoms and ethical principles. Transparency is necessary for relevant national and international liability regimes to work effectively."_GV.OC-03_GV.RR-01_GV.PO-01_transparency_medium
38_"People should be fully informed when a decision is informed by or is made on the basis of AI algorithms, including when it affects their safety or human rights, and in those circumstances should have the opportunity to request explanatory information from the relevant AI actor or public sector institutions."_GV.RR-02_PR.AT-01_RS.CO-02_transparency_high
38_"individuals should be able to access the reasons for a decision affecting their rights and freedoms, and have the option of making submissions to a designated staff member of the private sector company or public sector institution able to review and correct the decision."_GV.RR-02_PR.AT-01_RS.CO-02_transparency_high

39_"transparency can enable people to understand how each stage of an AI system is put in place, appropriate to the context and sensitivity of the AI system. It may also include insight into factors that affect a specific prediction or decision, and whether or not appropriate assurances (such as safety or fairness measures) are in place."_PR.AT-01; PR.AT-02_GV.RR-02_RS.CO-02_transparency_medium
40_"Explainability refers to making intelligible and providing insight into the outcome of AI systems. The explainability of AI systems also refers to the understandability of the input, output and the functioning of each algorithmic building block and how it contributes to the outcome of the systems."_PR.AT-01_GV.RR-02_RS.CO-02_transparency_low
40_"AI actors should commit to ensuring that the algorithms developed are explainable. In the case of AI applications that impact the end user in a way that is not temporary, easily reversible or otherwise low risk, it should be ensured that the meaningful explanation is provided with any decision that resulted in the action taken"_GV.RR-02; PR.AT-01_RS.CO-02_GV.OC-03_transparency_high
