1_Under the leadership of top management and with due consideration for trade secrets, companies that develop and operate AI systems and those that provide data should clarify and actively share AI system operational issues that the company or department is unable to fully address on their own and the information necessary to address these issues_GV.SC-02; GV.SC-03_RS.CO-03_GV.RR-02_transparency_High_
1_We ask our customers to monitor the AI system's output and we also provide instructions on how to determine if there has been any deterioration in quality_DE.CM-01; DE.CM-09_ID.RA-01_DE.AE-02__High_
1_We need to take our time to explain and get customers to understand reasons why the AI systems need maintenance, causes that make maintenance necessary_PR.AT-01_GV.OC-02_RS.CO-03_transparency_High_
1_After the AI system is re-trained, the developer should give a detailed explanation on how its outputs have changed after re-training to the customers_PR.AT-02_RS.CO-03_GV.OC-02_transparency_High_
2_In addition to providing explanations on the data used for training, etc., as well as overviews of the models used and explanations on accuracy and other performance parameters, we also explain, to AI system operators who intend to provide the AI system to AI system users, the situations and targets that the AI system should not apply_PR.AT-01; PR.AT-02_GV.OC-02_RS.CO-03_transparency_High_
6_In order to improve users' confidence in AI systems, we believe it is important for us to reduce the burden on users as much as possible by devising ways to prevent problems from occurring, and by responding promptly when problems do occur_GV.OC-02; GV.RR-01_ID.RA-05_PR.AT-01_transparency_High_
6_Because of the so-called black-box aspect of AI, it tends to be difficult to find out who is responsible. In order to prevent incidents, it is important to allocate responsibilities to those who are able to mitigate negative impacts_GV.RR-02_GV.SC-02_ID.RA-06_transparency_High_
6_It is also important to improve our ability to respond early to incidents by preparing for possible incidents_RS.MA-01; RS.MA-02_ID.RA-05_DE.AE-02__High_
7_Measures to address such uncertainties include approaches aimed at reducing uncertainties in the AI system development stage, including preparing appropriate data sets, selecting appropriate models, and conducting verification and testing before the AI system is put into operation_ID.RA-01; ID.RA-09_PR.DS-01_PR.PS-06_data protection_High_
7_And equally important are approaches that aim to control uncertainties through measures during the operation of AI systems, including the monitoring of AI system operations_DE.CM-01; DE.CM-09_ID.RA-05_PR.PS-04__High_
7_In cases where an AI system is developed and operated by different parties, in principle, the parties should appropriately allocate burdens of addressing uncertainties associated with the provision of AI in contract and etc., taking into account options that are realistically available to each party_GV.SC-02; GV.SC-05_GV.RR-02_ID.RA-06__High_
7_The developer of an AI system (trained model) guarantees neither perfect completion of the work nor the performance, quality, etc. of deliverables, but owes a certain level of duty of care in performing the work_GV.RR-02_GV.SC-02_PR.PS-06__High_definition
8_No matter who is held legally liable ultimately, since we came to recognize that if a user asked us for explanations about AI systems that we operate, we would not be exempt from all of the responsibilities to respond to these requests, at least as the first responder_GV.RR-02_RS.CO-02_GV.OC-02_transparency_High_
8_We have shifted our policy to one where we do whatever is in an AI system operator's capacity to reduce risk and explain these efforts as necessary with help from AI developers_GV.RR-01; GV.RR-02_ID.RA-06_RS.CO-03_transparency_Medium_
8_The quality of data to be outsourced before the provision can only be controlled by the outsourcer_PR.DS-01_ID.AM-07_GV.SC-05_data protection_Medium_definition
9_As part of our readiness for incidents when they occur, we have set up a contact point from outside, assigned an officer in charge of response, and established a contact system within the company, as well as a contact system for external parties and experts_RS.CO-02; RS.CO-03_GV.RR-02_RS.MA-01__High_
9_We have set up a communication and coordination system for the risk management, legal, public relations, and crisis management divisions, as well as a contact system for external parties and experts_GV.RR-02; GV.SC-02_RS.CO-02_RS.MA-01__High_
9_We strive to regularly update our technical and operational mechanisms that are designed to reduce system risks even in the event of unexpected situations_ID.IM-01; ID.IM-03_PR.IR-03_ID.RA-05__High_
11_We asked the developer to provide a way of automatically logging the inputs and outputs that significantly impact performance, and teach us how to perform the monitoring_DE.CM-09_PR.PS-04_DE.AE-02__High_
13_Companies should appropriately make information disclosure in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, but should also strive to actively provide information beyond that required by law_GV.OC-03_GV.PO-01_RS.CO-02_transparency_High_
13_The board should recognize that disclosed information will serve as the basis for constructive dialogue with shareholders, and therefore ensure that such information, particularly non-financial information, is accurate, clear and useful_GV.OC-02_GV.PO-01_RS.CO-02_transparency_High_
13_The disclosure of information on risk assessments and actions associated with AI system development and operation may also be expected in some cases as part of such non-financial information_GV.PO-01_ID.RA-06_RS.CO-02_transparency_Medium_
14_We have a company-wide BCP (Business Continuity Plan) in place. Because we may encounter business continuity issues if any of the AI systems we run shuts down, we decided to include AI incidents as one of triggers of BCP_ID.IM-04_PR.IR-03_RC.RP-01__High_
15_We regularly perform analyses of conditions and risks, and report to management even during normal times where we do not see any near misses or a significant increase in public attention to specific incidents, or changes in the regulatory environment_ID.RA-05; ID.RA-06_DE.AE-02_GV.OV-01__High_
42_It is important for AI system operators to understand the capabilities and limitations of AI systems through dialogue with AI system developers, and excessive reliance on automatic monitoring and other such tools should be avoided_PR.AT-01; PR.AT-02_GV.OC-02_DE.CM-09__High_
43_We believe that AI system development is not merely a technological activity, but one that must be founded on in-depth understanding of our society_GV.OC-01_GV.RR-01_GV.PO-01__Medium_definition
47_Our potential customers and users of our AI systems see AI systems as a sociotechnical tool rather than a technical tool_GV.OC-02_GV.RR-01_PR.AT-01__Low_definition
