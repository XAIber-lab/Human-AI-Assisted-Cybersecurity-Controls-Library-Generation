Page 1_In meeting the challenge, it should be recognized that there are existing norms and controls that have a role to play in ensuring that accountability is maintained._GV.OV-03_GV.OV-02__Medium

Page 1_For example, contractual arrangements between the A/IS provider and a party acquiring and applying a system may help to specify who is (and is not) to be held liable in the event the system produces undesirable results._GV.SC-05_GV.RM-06; GV.RM-03__High

Page 1_Individuals responsible for the design of A/IS will have to maintain a transparent record of the sources of the various components of their systems, including identification of which components were developed in-house and which were acquired from outside sources, whether open source or acquired from another firm._ID.AM-02; ID.AM-08_GV.SC-01__High

Page 1_The goal of clarifying lines of responsibility in the operation of A/IS is to implement a governing model that specifies who is responsible for what, and who has recourse to which corrective actions, i.e., a trustworthy model that ensures that it will admit actionable answers should questions of accountability arise._GV.RR-02; GV.RR-01_GV.OV-03_GV.RM-01_transparency_High

Page 2_Such policies could take the form of, for example, designating an official specifically charged with oversight of the organization's procurement, deployment, and evaluation of A/IS as well as the organization's efforts to educate people both inside and outside the organization on its use of A/IS._GV.RR-02_PR.AT-01; PR.AT-02__High

Page 2_Such policies might also include the establishment of a review board to assess the organization's use of A/IS and to ensure that lines of responsibility for the outcomes of its use are maintained._GV.OV-03_GV.OV-01__High

Page 2_The combination of a governing model of accountability and an openness to meaningful audit will allow the maintenance of accountability, even in complex deployments of A/IS in the service of a legal system._GV.OV-03_GV.RR-02_GV.OV-01_Medium

Page 2_These issues will continue to be litigated as A/IS tools continue to proliferate in judicial systems. To that end, as the Loomis court notes, "The justice system must keep up with the research and continuously assess the use of these tools."_ID.RA-06_ID.IM-01_GV.OV-02_High

Page 14_Governments should, where appropriate, work together with A/IS developers, as well as other stakeholders in the effective functioning of the legal system, to facilitate the creation of error-sharing mechanisms to enable the more effective identification, isolation, and correction of flaws in broadly deployed A/IS in their legal systems._RS.CO-03_ID.IM-02_ID.RA-08_High
