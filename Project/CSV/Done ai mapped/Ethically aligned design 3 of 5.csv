6_Autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS) research and design must be developed against the backdrop that technology is not neutral. A/IS embody values and biases that can influence important social processes like voting policing and banking. To ensure that A/IS benefit humanity A/IS research and design must be underpinned by ethical and legal norms. These should be instantiated through values-based research and design methods._GV.OC-03_GV.PO-01_GV.RR-01_medium_definition
