7_The Interim Measures relax some of the requirements set out in the Draft Measures, reflecting the China government's intention to encourage development of generative AI service – while at the same time setting out obligations regarding content management, protection and security of personal data, and transparency of generative AI within China_GV.OC-03_GV.PO-02__privacy; transparency_Medium_
1_With its promises of greater efficiencies and transformational capabilities, comes risks relating to data privacy, misinformation, biased or inaccurate answers, and lack of transparency on how decisions affecting people's livelihoos are being made_ID.RA-03_GV.RM-06__privacy; transparency_Medium_

2_China has been particularly proactive (by global standards) in developing a regulatory framework of AI – with the aim of balancing fostering innovation versus maintaining control of the technology sector_GV.OC-03_GV.PO-01___Medium_
3_The Interim Measures regulate the provision of generative AI services in China and have been substantially amended from the Draft Measures to be more commercial, research and innovation-friendly, as well as recognising possible foreign investment in developing and providing generative AI services in China_GV.OC-03_GV.PO-02___Medium_
4_Generative AI Service Provider refers to an entity or individual that uses generative AI technologies to provide Generative AI Services, including providers of the underlying generative AI technologies and any person who provides applications on top of such technologies via APIs_GV.OC-02____Low_definition
4_Generative AI Service User refers to an entity or individual that uses contents generated from the Generative AI Services_GV.OC-02____Low_definition
5_The Draft Measures included a requirement to take measures within three months through model optimization training to prevent illegal content from being generated again – this has been removed from the Interim Measures_GV.PO-02_GV.RM-04___Medium_

7_There are still some questions to be answered. Notably, the Interim Measures also state that there may be further classified and graded regulations applicable to generative AI services_GV.OC-03____Low_
7_Some of the aspects within the Interim Measures will likely be developed – such as copyright status/protection of any materials arising from generative AI, how and the extent to which algorithms are to be disclosed, and how phrases such as "support the public opinion or mobilize the public" will be interpreted_GV.PO-02_GV.OC-03__transparency_Medium_
7_The Interim Measures also represent a new addition to China's regulatory framework for data_GV.OC-03____Low_
