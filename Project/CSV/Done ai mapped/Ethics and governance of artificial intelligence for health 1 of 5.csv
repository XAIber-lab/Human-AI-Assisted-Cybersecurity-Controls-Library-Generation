20_Documentation and transparency, risk management and the life-cycle approach, data quality, analytical and clinical validation, engagement and collaboration, and privacy and data protection_GV.RM-06_ID.RA-05_PR.DS-01_data protection; transparency_High_

1_Digital health technologies are already used widely in LMIC, including for data collection, dissemination of health information by mobile phones and extended use of electronic medical records on open-software platforms and cloud computing_ID.AM-02_PR.DS-01_GV.OC-01__Low_definition

8_Yet, clinical experience and knowledge about patients is essential, and AI will not be a substitute for clinical due diligence for the foreseeable future_GV.RR-01_PR.AT-01___Medium_

10_Although such monitoring of healthy individuals could generate data to predict or detect health risks or improve a person's treatment when necessary, it raises concern, as it permits near-constant surveillance and collection of excessive data that otherwise should remain unknown or uncollected_PR.DS-01_GV.RM-02_ID.RA-04_privacy_High_

10_Thus, such data should be liable to the same levels of data protection and security as for data collected in a formal clinical care setting_PR.DS-01; PR.DS-02_GV.PO-01__data protection_High_

17_Human rights organizations have interpreted and, when necessary, adapted existing human rights laws and standards to AI assessment_GV.OC-03____Low_definition

19_Data protection laws are rights-based approaches that provide standards for regulating data processing that both protect the rights of individuals and establish obligations for data controllers and processors_GV.PO-01_PR.DS-01__data protection_Medium_definition

9_In LMIC, for example, AI could be used in the management of antiretroviral therapy by predicting resistance to HIV drugs and disease progression, to help physicians optimize therapy_ID.RA-04_GV.OC-01___Low_definition

7_The wider use of AI in medicine also has technological challenges. Although many prototypes developed in both the public and the private sectors have performed well in field tests, they often cannot be translated, commercialized or deployed_ID.RA-01_GV.SC-06___Medium_

8_Health-care workers will have to adapt their clinical practice significantly as use of AI increases. AI could automate tasks, giving doctors time to listen to patients, address their fears and concerns_PR.AT-01_GV.RR-02___Medium_

8_Doctors will have to update their competence to communicate risks, make predictions and discuss trade-offs with patients and also express their ethical and legal concern about understanding AI technology_PR.AT-02_GV.RR-02___High_

14_Nevertheless, few such systems have been evaluated in prospective clinical trials. A recent comparison of deep-learning algorithms with health-care professionals showed that AI is equivalent to human medical judgement in specific domains_ID.RA-09_DE.AE-02___Medium_

14_Other questions are whether the performance of AI can be generalized to implementation in practice and whether AI trained for use in one context can be used accurately and safely in a different geographical region or context_ID.RA-05_GV.SC-07___High_

15_In some cases, early AI screening tools for SARS-CoV2 were utter junk with which companies were trying to capitalise on the panic and anxiety_ID.RA-01___transparency_Low_definition

15_As for all AI technologies, their actual effectiveness depends on whether the datasets are representative of the populations in which the technologies are used, and they remain questionable without systematic testing and evaluation_ID.RA-09_PR.DS-01_DE.AE-02__High_

15_New symptom checkers are based on machine learning to provide advice to patients, although their effectiveness is not yet known; all symptom checkers require that users provide accurate information_ID.RA-04_DE.AE-02___Medium_

12_In settings with limited resources, AI could be used to conduct screening and evaluation if insufficient medical expertise is available_GV.OC-01____Low_definition

12_AI tools could also be used to guide allocation of other scarce health resources during the COVID-19 pandemic_ID.RA-04____Low_definition

11_It has been suggested that machine-learning algorithms could be trained and used to assist in decisions to ration supplies, identify which individuals should receive critical care_ID.RA-05_GV.RM-04___Medium_

9_Many low-income settings facing chronic shortages of healthcare workers require assistance in diagnosis and assessment and to reduce their workload_GV.OC-01____Low_definition

23_Deal with persons in ways that respect their interests in making decisions about their lives and their person, including health-care decisions, according to informed understanding_GV.RR-01_PR.AT-01__transparency_High_

12_Yet, whether AI can advance beyond narrow tasks depends on numerous factors beyond the state of AI science and on the trust of providers, patients and health-care professionals in AI-based technologies_GV.OC-02_ID.RA-04___Medium_
