6_As AI technologies advance rapidly, EUIs must consider carefully when and how to use generative AI responsibly and beneficially for public good. All stages of a generative AI solution life cycle should operate in accordance with the applicable legal frameworks, including the Regulation, when the system involves the processing of personal data_GV.RR-01_GV.OC-03_GV.PO-01__High_
6_The terms trustworthy or responsible AI refer to the need to ensure that AI systems are developed in an ethical and legal way. It entails considering the unintended consequences of the use of AI technology and the need to follow a risk-based approach covering all the stages of the life cycle of the system_GV.RM-01_GV.OC-02__transparency_High_definition
6_In this context, generative AI systems must be transparent, explainable, consistent, auditable and accessible, as a way to ensure fair processing of personal data_GV.PO-01_ID.RA-05__transparency;data protection_High_
6_EUIs can develop and deploy their own generative AI solutions or can alternatively deploy for their own use solutions available on the market. In both cases, EUIs may use providers to obtain all or some of the elements that are part of the generative AI system_GV.SC-01_GV.SC-02__data protection_Medium_definition
6_EUIs must clearly determine the specific roles - controller, processor, joint controllership - for the specific processing operations carried out and their implications in terms of obligations and responsibilities under the Regulation_GV.RR-02_GV.SC-02_PR.AA-05_data protection_High_
7_When a developer or a provider of a generative AI system claims that their system does not process personal data, it is crucial to ask about the specific controls that have been put in place to guarantee this_ID.RA-01_ID.AM-08__data protection_High_
9_The principles of data protection by design and by default aim to protect personal data throughout the entire life cycle of data processing, starting from the inception stage. By complying with this principle of the Regulation, based on a risk-oriented approach, the threats and risks that generative AI may entail can be considered and be mitigated sufficiently in advance_ID.RA-05_GV.RM-06_PR.DS-01_data protection_High_
9_Data protection risks must be identified and addressed throughout the entire life cycle of the generative AI system. This includes regular and systematic monitoring to determine, as the system evolves, whether risks already identified are worsening or whether new risks are appearing_ID.RA-05_DE.CM-01_ID.IM-01_data protection_High_
9_If risks that cannot be mitigated by reasonable means are identified, it is time to consult the EDPS_ID.RA-06_GV.RM-04__data protection_High_
10_If following the DPIA, controllers are not sure whether risks are appropriately mitigated, they should proceed to a prior consultation with the EDPS_ID.RA-06_GV.SC-06__data protection_High_
12_EUIs have a specific responsibility to verify that providers of generative AI systems have complied with the conditions of application of this legal basis, taking into account the specific conditions of processing carried out by these systems_GV.SC-07_ID.RA-10__data protection_Medium_
12_As controllers for the processing of personal data, EUIs are accountable for the transfers of personal data that they initiate and for those that are carried out on their behalf within and outside the European Economic Area_GV.RR-01_PR.DS-02_GV.SC-05_data protection_High_
14_EUIs should develop and use models trained with high quality datasets limited to the personal data necessary to fulfil the purpose of the processing. In this way, these datasets should be well labelled and curated, within the framework of appropriate data governance procedures, including periodic and systematic review of the content_ID.AM-07_PR.DS-01_PR.PS-01_data protection_High_
14_The use of large amounts of data to train a generative AI system does not necessarily imply greater effectiveness or better results. The careful design of well-structured datasets, to be used in systems that prioritise quality over quantity, following a properly supervised training process, and subject to regular monitoring, is essential to achieve the expected results_ID.AM-08_PR.DS-01_DE.CM-09_data protection_Medium_
15_When EUIs use a generative AI system or training, testing or validation datasets provided by a third party, contractual assurances and documentation must be obtained on the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the data used for the development of the system_GV.SC-05_ID.RA-09_PR.DS-01_data protection_High_
17_EUIs must provide to individuals all the information required in the Regulation when using generative AI systems that process personal data. The information provided to individuals must be updated when necessary to keep them properly informed and in control of their own data_GV.OC-03_RS.CO-02__transparency;data protection_High_
17_Appropriate information and transparency policies can help mitigate risks to individuals and ensure compliance with the requirements of the Regulation, in particular, by providing detailed information on how, when and why EUIs process personal data in generative AI systems_GV.PO-01_GV.OC-02_RS.CO-03_transparency;data protection_High_
20_It is essential that the datasets used to create and train models ensure an adequate and fair representation of the real world - without bias that can increase the potential harm for individuals or collectives not well represented in the training datasets_ID.AM-07_PR.DS-01__data protection_High_
20_The application of procedures and best practices for bias minimisation and mitigation should be a priority in all stages of the lifecycle of generative AI systems, to ensure fair processing and to avoid discriminatory practices_ID.IM-01_PR.PS-06__data protection_High_
22_EUIs, as data controllers, are responsible for and accountable for implementing appropriate technical, organisational and procedural measures to ensure the effective exercise of individual rights. Those measures should be designed and implemented from the early stages of the lifecycle of the system, allowing for detailed recording and traceability of processing activities_GV.RR-01_PR.PS-04_GV.OV-03_transparency_High_
23_Controllers should, in addition to the traditional security controls for IT systems, integrate specific controls tailored to the already known vulnerabilities of these systems - model inversion attacks, prompt injection, jailbreaks - in a way that facilitates continuous monitoring and assessment of their effectiveness_PR.PS-01_DE.CM-09_ID.RA-01_data protection_High_
23_Controllers are advised to only use datasets provided by trusted sources and carry out regularly verification and validation procedures, including for in-house datasets_ID.RA-09_PR.DS-01__data protection_High_
23_As risks evolve quickly, regular monitoring and updates of the risk assessment are needed_ID.RA-05_DE.CM-01__data protection_High_
23_A possible way to deal with unknown risks is to use 'red teaming' techniques to try to find and expose vulnerabilities_ID.RA-01_ID.IM-02__data protection_Medium_
23_When using Retrieval Augmented Generation with generative AI systems, it is necessary to test that the generative AI system is not leaking personal data that might be present in the system's knowledge base_PR.DS-01_DE.CM-09__data protection_High_
23_EUIs must be aware of the risks derived from attacks by malicious third parties and the available tools to mitigate them_ID.RA-03_ID.RA-02__data protection_Medium_
