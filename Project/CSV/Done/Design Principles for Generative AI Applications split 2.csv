5;"generative AI algorithms produce artifacts, rather than decision boundaries, as outputs"
5;"one challenge of this paradigm stems from the distinguishing characteristic of generative AI: it generates artifacts as outputs and those outputs may vary in character or quality, even when a user's input does not change"
6;"alongside their tremendous potential to augment people's creative capabilities, generative technologies also introduce new risks and potential user harms. These risks include issues of copyright and intellectual property, the circumvention or reverse-engineering of prompts through attacks, the production of hateful, toxic, or profane language, the disclosure of sensitive or personal information, the production of malicious source code, and a lack of representation of minority groups due to underrepresentation in the training data"
7;"Test & monitor for user harms. Identify relevant user harms (e.g. bias, toxic content, misinformation) and include mechanisms that test and monitor for them"
7;"Expose or limit emergent behaviors. Determine whether generative capabilities beyond the intended use case should be surfaced to the user or restricted"
7;"Evaluate outputs using domain-specific metrics. Help the user identify outputs that satisfy measurable quality criteria"
7;"Make uncertainty visible. Caution the user that outputs may not align with their expectations and identify detectable uncertainties or flaws"
7;"Use friction to avoid overreliance. Encourage the user to review and think critically about outputs by designing mechanisms that slow them down at key decision-making points"
7;"Calibrate trust using explanations. Be clear and upfront about how well the AI system performs different tasks by explaining its capabilities and limitations"
7;"Provide rationales for outputs. Show the user why a particular output was generated by identifying the source materials used to generate it"
7;"Signify the role of the AI. Determine the role the AI system will take within the user's workflow"
8;"Understand the user's mental model. Build upon the user's existing mental models and evaluate how they think about your application: its capabilities, limitations, and how to work with it effectively"
8;"Teach the AI system about the user. Capture the user's expectations, behaviors, and preferences to improve the AI system's interactions with them"
