List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to safe and secure use, develop, and provision of a system and an AI system.;7;Studies have shown that many ML practitioners aren't aware of the specific vulnerabilities of many ML algorithms, or don't have the right tools to assess these vulnerabilities in the first place. This can create a poor security culture and heightens the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced to a system.
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to safe and secure use, develop, and provision of a system and an AI system.;8;Strengthen your people Enable and encourage a positive security culture and accountability by ensuring team members have the relevant security knowledge. Support this by providing training on the threats that are unique to ML components, where knowledge gaps are identified.
List in detail every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines and norm related to defend, protect, and monitor the system and AI system, and how to handle logs.;2;In operation: Continual / online learning
List in detail every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines and norm related to defend, protect, and monitor the system and AI system, and how to handle logs.;6;Monitor and log your users' inference requests and queries
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to the users, to maintain them safe and to protect their privacy.;6;Monitor and log your users' inference requests and queries
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, and norm related to the users and stakeholders rights, how to allow them to exercise their rights, and what they have to be communicated about.;8;Encourage best security practices by making sure security reviews are integrated into your system lifecycle processes. Make people accountable for these processes and use automation where appropriate.
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to the law, legislation, regulations, standardization, rules compliance, and context.;3;Without properly understanding and mitigating these vulnerabilities, system designers can't assure stakeholders, and ultimately users, that an AI system is safe and secure.
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to risk, like risk assessment, risk management, risk evaluation, risk response, risk mitigation, vulnerabilities identification, threat identification, risk impact, risk severity, and risk probability.;7;Once you've decided to develop an ML system, there are security questions you need to consider. Many decisions at this stage will be driven by scope: do you intend your model to be operational, or for research purposes only? If the system fails or comes under attack, what are the implications for the wider system in which the ML component will sit? The answers will give you an early indication of your appetite for security risk.
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to risk, like risk assessment, risk management, risk evaluation, risk response, risk mitigation, vulnerabilities identification, threat identification, risk impact, risk severity, and risk probability.;9;What does your system look like if the ML component fails? Identify harm done virtually, physically and reputationally. How will you identify if your system has 'failed'?
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to control, evaluation, verification, validation, and testing of systems, AI systems, networks, and components, also regarding their lifecycle.;4;These principles aim to be wide reaching and applicable to anyone developing, deploying or operating a system with a machine learning (ML) component. They are not a comprehensive assurance framework to grade a system or workflow, and do not provide a checklist. Instead, they provide context and structure to help scientists, engineers, decision makers and risk owners make educated decisions about system design and development processes, helping to assess the specific threats to a system.
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to control, evaluation, verification, validation, and testing of systems, AI systems, networks, and components, also regarding their lifecycle.;6;Track and test continual learning models
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to data and informations, how data have to be protected, classified, stored, and which mechanisms are implemented regarding data and data protection, and data validation.;2;Secure your infrastructure (digital assets)
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to data access control.;6;Limit access to your model
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to assets, to manage assets related risks, to secure assets, to verify and authenticate assets.;2;Track your assets
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to assets, to manage assets related risks, to secure assets, to verify and authenticate assets.;6;Document the creation, operation and lifecycle management of assets
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to the developers, deployers, providers, system actors and AI actors, their roles, rights, responsibilities, and duties.;7;It's therefore important to establish a positive security culture, supported by leaders, providing sufficient credibility so that security is considered at the start of a project.
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to the developers, deployers, providers, system actors and AI actors, their roles, rights, responsibilities, and duties.;8;Ensuring that your ML practitioners, data scientists and software developers are familiar with the inherent vulnerabilities and failure modes in ML workflows and algorithms. They should follow best practices to reasonably mitigate the threats associated with them
