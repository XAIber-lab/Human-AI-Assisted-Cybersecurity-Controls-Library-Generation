List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to risk, like risk assessment, risk management, risk evaluation, risk response, risk mitigation, vulnerabilities identification, threat identification, risk impact, risk severity, and risk probability.;4;"Create processes and frameworks to assess disparate impact and safety risks well before the model is deployed or procured. Designate accountable people to mitigate these risks."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to risk, like risk assessment, risk management, risk evaluation, risk response, risk mitigation, vulnerabilities identification, threat identification, risk impact, risk severity, and risk probability.;5;"AI model investment does not stop at deployment. Dedicate resources to ensure models continue to behave as desired and expected. Assess and mitigate risk throughout the AI lifecycle, not just after deployment."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to control, evaluation, verification, validation, and testing of systems, AI systems, networks, and components, also regarding their lifecycle.;2;"Detailing ethics practices throughout the AI lifecycle, corresponding to business (or mission) goals, data preparation and modeling, evaluation and deployment. The CRISP-DM model is useful here. IBM's Scaled Data Science Method, an extension of CRISP-DM, offers governance across the AI model lifecycle informed by collaborative input from data scientists, industrial-organizational psychologists, designers, communication specialists and others. The method merges best practices in data science, project management, design frameworks and AI governance. Teams can easily see and understand the requirements at each stage of the lifecycle, including documentation, who they need to talk to or collaborate with, and next steps."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to control, evaluation, verification, validation, and testing of systems, AI systems, networks, and components, also regarding their lifecycle.;3;"Using auditing tools to reflect the bias exhibited in models. If the reflection aligns with the values of the organization, transparency surrounding the chosen data and methods is key. If the reflection does not align with organizational values, then this is a signal that something must change. Discovering and mitigating potential disparate impact caused by bias involves far more than examining the data the model was trained on. Organizations must also examine people and processes involved. For example, have appropriate and inappropriate uses of the model been clearly communicated?"
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to control, evaluation, verification, validation, and testing of systems, AI systems, networks, and components, also regarding their lifecycle.;5;"Include measures of accuracy in regularly scheduled audits. Be unequivocally forthright about how model performance compares to a human being. If the model fails to provide an accurate result, detail who is accountable for that model and what recourse users have. (This should all be baked into the interpretable, findable metadata)."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to data access control.;4;"Provide content grounding for AI models. Empower domain experts to curate and maintain trusted sources of data used to train models. Model output is based on the data it was trained on."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to assets, to manage assets related risks, to secure assets, to verify and authenticate assets.;4;"Capture key metadata to render AI models transparent and keep track of model inventory. Make sure that this metadata is interpretable and that the right information is exposed to the appropriate personnel."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to assets, to manage assets related risks, to secure assets, to verify and authenticate assets.;5;"Capture and manage AI model inventory as described above."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to assets, to manage assets related risks, to secure assets, to verify and authenticate assets.;5;"Deploy cybersecurity measures across all models."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to the developers, deployers, providers, system actors and AI actors, their roles, rights, responsibilities, and duties.;2;"DoD personnel will exercise appropriate levels of judgment and care, while remaining responsible for the development, deployment, and use of AI capabilities."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to the developers, deployers, providers, system actors and AI actors, their roles, rights, responsibilities, and duties.;3;"The Department's AI capabilities will be developed and deployed such that relevant personnel possess an appropriate understanding of the technology, development processes, and operational methods applicable to AI capabilities, including with transparent and auditable methodologies, data sources, and design procedure and documentation."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to the developers, deployers, providers, system actors and AI actors, their roles, rights, responsibilities, and duties.;3;"The Department's AI capabilities will have explicit, well-defined uses, and the safety, security, and effectiveness of such capabilities will be subject to testing and assurance within those defined uses across their entire life cycles."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to the developers, deployers, providers, system actors and AI actors, their roles, rights, responsibilities, and duties.;3;"The Department will design and engineer AI capabilities to fulfill their intended functions while possessing the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences, and the ability to disengage or deactivate deployed systems that demonstrate unintended behavior."
