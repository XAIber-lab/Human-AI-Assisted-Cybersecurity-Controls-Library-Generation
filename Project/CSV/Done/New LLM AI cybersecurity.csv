3;AI System Safety/Security;□ Create an AI solution onboarding process.
3;AI System Safety/Security;□ Ensure skilled IT admin staff is available either internally or externally, following SBoM requirements.
4;User Safety and Privacy;□ Actively engage with employees to understand and address concerns with planned LLM initiatives.
4;User Safety and Privacy;□ Establish a culture of open, and transparent communication on the organization's use of predictive or generative AI within the organization process, systems, employee management and support, and customer engagements and how its use is governed, managed, and risks addressed.
4;User Safety and Privacy;□ Train all users on ethics, responsibility, and legal issues such as warranty, license, and copyright.
4;User Safety and Privacy;□ Update security awareness training to include GenAI related threats. Voice cloning and image cloning, as well as in anticipation of increased spear phishing attacks
4;User Safety and Privacy;□ Any adopted GenAI solutions should include training for both DevOps and cybersecurity for the deployment pipeline to ensure AI safety and security assurances.
5;Legal Compliance;□ Establish the organization's AI RACI chart (who is responsible, who is accountable, who should be consulted, and who should be informed)
5;Legal Compliance;□ Document and assign AI risk, risk assessments, and governance responsibility within the organization.
5;Legal Compliance;□ Establish data management policies, including technical enforcement, regarding data classification and usage limitations. Models should only leverage data classified for the minimum access level of any user of the system. For example, update the data protection policy to emphasize not to input protected or confidential data into nonbusiness-managed tools.
5;Legal Compliance;□ Create an AI Policy supported by established policy (e.g., standard of good conduct, data protection, software use)
5;Legal Compliance;□ Publish an acceptable use matrix for various generative AI tools for employees to use.
5;Legal Compliance;□ Document the sources and management of any data that the organization uses from the generative LLM models.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Confirm product warranties are clear in the product development stream to assign who is responsible for product warranties with AI.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Review and update existing terms and conditions for any GenAI considerations.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Review AI EULA agreements. End-user license agreements for GenAI platforms are very different in how they handle user prompts, output rights and ownership, data privacy, compliance, liability, privacy, and limits on how output can be used.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Organizations EULA for customers, Modify end-user agreements to prevent the organization from incurring liabilities related to plagiarism, bias propagation, or intellectual property infringement through AI-generated content.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Review existing AI-assisted tools used for code development. A chatbot's ability to write code can threaten a company's ownership rights to its product if a chatbot is used to generate code for the product. For example, it could call into question the status and protection of the generated content and who holds the right to use the generated content.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Review any risks to intellectual property. Intellectual property generated by a chatbot could be in jeopardy if improperly obtained data was used during the generative process, which is subject to copyright, trademark, or patent protection. If AI products use infringing material, it creates a risk for the outputs of the AI, which may result in intellectual property infringement.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Review any contracts with indemnification provisions. Indemnification clauses try to put the responsibility for an event that leads to liability on the person who was more at fault for it or who had the best chance of stopping it. Establish guardrails to determine whether the provider of the AI or its user caused the event, giving rise to liability.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Review liability for potential injury and property damage caused by AI systems.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Review insurance coverage. Traditional (D&O) liability and commercial general liability insurance policies are likely insufficient to fully protect AI use.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Identify any copyright issues. Human authorship is required for copyright. An organization may also be liable for plagiarism, propagation of bias, or intellectual property infringement if LLM tools are misused.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Ensure agreements are in place for contractors and appropriate use of AI for any development or provided services.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Restrict or prohibit the use of generative AI tools for employees or contractors where enforceable rights may be an issue or where there are IP infringement concerns.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Assess and AI solutions used for employee management or hiring could result in disparate treatment claims or disparate impact claims.
5-6;Legal Compliance;□ Make sure the AI solutions do not collect or share sensitive information without proper consent or authorization.
7;Legal Compliance;□ Determine Country, State, or other Government specific AI compliance requirements.
7;Legal Compliance;□ Determine compliance requirements for restricting electronic monitoring of employees and employment-related automated decision systems (Vermont, California, Maryland, New York, New Jersey)
7;Legal Compliance;□ Determine compliance requirements for consent for facial recognition and the AI video analysis required (Illinois, Maryland, Washington, Vermont)
7;Legal Compliance;□ Review any AI tools in use or being considered for employee hiring or management.
7;Legal Compliance;□ Confirm the vendor's compliance with applicable AI laws and best practices.
7;Legal Compliance;□ Ask and document any products using AI during the hiring process. Ask how the model was trained, and how it is monitored, and track any corrections made to avoid discrimination and bias.
7;Legal Compliance;□ Ask and document what accommodation options are included.
7;Legal Compliance;□ Ask and document whether the vendor collects confidential data.
7;Legal Compliance;□ Ask how the vendor or tool stores and deletes data and regulates the use of facial recognition and video analysis tools during pre-employment.
7;Legal Compliance;□ Review other organization-specific regulatory requirements with AI that may raise compliance issues. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, for instance, has fiduciary duty requirements for retirement plans that a chatbot might not be able to meet.
8;Secure Design/Development/Deployment;□ Threat Model LLM components and architecture trust boundaries.
8;Secure Design/Development/Deployment;□ Data Security, verify how data is classified and protected based on sensitivity, including personal and proprietary business data. (How are user permissions managed, and what safeguards are in place?)

2;Risk Assessment;□ How will attackers accelerate exploit attacks against the organization, employees, executives, or users? Organizations should anticipate "hyper-personalized" attacks at scale using Generative AI. LLM-assisted Spear Phishing attacks are now exponentially more effective, targeted, and weaponized for an attack.
2;Risk Assessment;□ How could GenAI be used for attacks on the business's customers or clients through spoofing or GenAI generated content?
