21;"● A systematic procedure for documenting the component implementation procedure must exist and be implemented in order to guarantee registration and subsequent acquisition of all necessary information to identify such component, its elements and its environment, understanding what it does and why it does it, and enables to verify code quality and legibility for auditing purposes: description of the programming language(s) used, most recent code version, commented-out code, necessary packages and libraries, and interfaces with other components, when appropriate, used APIs and useful documents such as requirements specifications, functional and organic analyses, guidelines, etc.";High

28;"● Monitoring mechanisms must be available for human operators for monitoring and verification purposes.";High
22;"● Data cleaning techniques and best practices used in the data cleansing process must be well grounded and documented.";Medium
23;"● Data minimisation criteria must have been determined and applied to the different stages of the AI component, using strategies such as data hiding, separation, abstraction, anonymisation and pseudonymisation as may apply for the purposes of maximising privacy in the operation of the relevant AI-based component.";High
23;"● Used databases must have an associated data dictionary that enables their analysis and understanding.";Medium
23;"● Data selection and assessment must have been carried out with the involvement of an expert in modelling techniques and data science who is in charge of understanding the complex processes from reality that are being modelled, and of analysing and interpreting the data used by the component.";Medium
24;"● Appropriate procedures must have been defined in order to identify and remove, or at least limit, any bias in the data used to train the relevant model.";High
24;"● It must have been verified that in training data used as input for the relevant model there are no previous historical biases and, if they are, a different and bias-free data source has been chosen or training data have undergone appropriate cleaning and scrubbing so that are suitable for use.";High
24;"● Human supervision mechanisms must have been implemented in order to control and ensure that results are bias-free.";High
24;"● The implemented mechanisms must enable data subjects to request human intervention, provide feedback or challenge the results obtained by means of automated decision-making algorithms.";High
22;"● Previously, used data must have been classified into categories, organizing them in non personal and personal data, and, for the latter, identifying which fields constitute identifiers, quasi-identifiers and special data categories.";High
22;"● The relevant variables for the model must have been determined, identifying the variables associated with special data categories and proxy variables, including the necessary information for their interpretation.";High
25;"● The testing plan must include reviews and, when appropriate, inspections for the purposes of early identification and remedy of defects in requirements or design, incorrect specifications or deviations from applicable criteria during development.";High
25;"● White-box testing of the network design or the AI component must be considered as part of the testing plan";High
25;"● White-box testing at code and implementation levels must be considered as part of the testing plan.";High
25;"● Black-box testing as required must be considered as part of the testing plan in order to ensure that functionality of AI-based component is guaranteed, that such component behaves as expected and that information integrity is preserved.";High
25;"● The validation test plan must include verification of boundary values and extreme test cases which may make the component to function in an unexpected manner.";High
26;"● Both the relevant parameters and their cut-off values must be determined so that the model considers certain variables in order to obtain significant results.";Medium
26;"● There must be procedures to detect whether the response of the AI-based component to input data is erroneous or exceeds a predetermined error threshold, or whether there are different error thresholds associated with different categories of data subjects in the data set.";High
