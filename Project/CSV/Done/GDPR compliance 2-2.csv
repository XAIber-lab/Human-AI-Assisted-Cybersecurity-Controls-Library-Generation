Página: 14 de 49;Any technical solution which does not provide a certified answer to those issues cannot be considered a mature technology, but merely a technology without the ability to comply with basic requirements of accountability, transparency and legality.
Página: 19 de 49;The decision to adopt, in the frame of a processing activity, a technical solution based on AI or other technology, is made by the controller, since it is the controller who "determines the means and purposes of processing", and, therefore, in charge of making the decision of which technological or other solution is to be used. Such controller is obliged to act with due diligence when selecting the most correct solution, particularly when outsourcing or acquiring the relevant development; they shall require and assess any quality specifications of the relevant solution, establish the scope of the processing and take the burden of facing the consequences of their decisions. The person in charge of conducting the processing shall be the person responsible, and they may not claim that they lacked information or technical knowledge to elude their responsibility to audit and decide whether a system is eligible. Transferring the responsibility to the AI system itself is not acceptable in any case.
Página: 16 de 49;One of the key aspects of the GDPR, which is central to determine whether accountability and transparency policies have been correctly implemented, is to duly identify the different roles and responsibilities within the processing.
Página: 16 de 49;In the different stages of the life cycle of an AI component, the personal data controllers shall be any natural or legal person, public authority or other organisation who makes the decision to conduct the aforementioned data processing as defined above. Therefore, different responsibilities shall entail different obligations in the framework of data processing.
