"41;Decommission your assets appropriately."
"41;An ML system is uniquely reliant on the data on which it was trained. Assets generated in this way can be used to extrapolate information about the original data on which they were trained, whether through traditional cyber attacks or ML specific attacks such as membership inference or model inversion. It's therefore important that these assets are treated and decommissioned appropriately, using destruction or archiving methods and conditions suitable for the type of data involved and its sensitivity."
"41;This is especially important when models are deployed at the edge of a network, outside of controlled environments."
"41;Retention, via archiving, should also be considered. If you have taken actions based on the output of an ML system, consider how long after those actions you reasonably need to be able to explain or defend them. If you need to explain something, consider whether it will be enough to have the logs, the model weights or the training data."
"41;You understand that your model is a representation of the data on which it was trained and should be decommissioned through the same, appropriate, process."
"41;You know that any data collected during the operational life of the model needs to be destroyed or archived appropriately, and recognise this is particularly important if models are deployed in untrusted or controlled environments."
"41;Your model's expected lifespan is captured in its metadata (eg, model card) as laid out in principle 2.5 - Requirements and development: track your assets."
"41;Data associated with the use of the model (eg, logs) is retained in an appropriate location and for an appropriate length of time for your system or organisational auditing requirements."
"42;Review how your asset's metadata states to decommission data and the underlying model. Evaluate if this is still appropriate and compliant."
"42;Review your asset's metadata (eg, model card)."
"42;Review guidance from relevant professional bodies for the sector in which the system is deployed."
"42;Where it's appropriate to dispose of material, ensure this is done securely and an appropriate method is used for the nature of the asset's sensitivity."
"42;Where it is appropriate to archive data (eg, for legal and/or compliance purposes), ensure this is done securely and an appropriate method is used for the nature of the asset's sensitivity."
"42;Collate lessons learned and share with the community."
"42;The process of knowledge transfer is particularly important while ML development and technology is still in its infancy. Successful knowledge transfer will ensure each generation of products or teams continues to improve, and mature design processes and the ways of working for this technology, improving security of systems in the future."
"42;At the end of a lifecycle it's therefore important to collate lessons learned and document them for others. This review is likely to include a range of aspects and stakeholders. It's important to review security design, events and how they were dealt with."
"43;You reassess security decisions taken during the design and development process, and consider how you would improved them, based on experienced throughout the operational phase"
"43;Security incidents that occur during the operational phase of the lifecycle are documented"
"43;Any specific information shared is done so, following appropriate security considerations"
"43;Develop a vulnerability disclosure process for your system and organisation. This will allow users to report vulnerabilities to you in a responsible way."
"43;Review best practice and develop a process for responsibly sharing relevant threat intelligence."
"43;Identify and share your knowledge at appropriate forums such as industry specific conferences, blogs and journals."
"43;Implement a knowledge management system. Encourage all stakeholders to contribute to this with their lessons learnt."
"43;Ensure all stakeholders have visibility of this knowledge relevant to their role."
"43;Provide the relevant reviews and training for each stakeholder."
