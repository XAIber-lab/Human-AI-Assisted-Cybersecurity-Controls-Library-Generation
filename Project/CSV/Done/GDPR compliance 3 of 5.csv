21;"In order to establish the legal grounds for the processing activity, it is important to bear in mind that special categories of data, as established by article 9 of the GDPR, include special processing requirements";medium
21-22;"it is required, according to the principle of accountability, to include an effective information governance model which enables traceability of information for the purposes of being able to identify the relevant controller and empower data subjects to exercise their rights";high
22;"The first layer should include: The identity of the of the data controller or their representative, The purpose of the processing, The possibility of exerting the rights included in articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR";high
22;"If the processing involves profiling or automated decisions: This circumstance must be clearly disclosed, Informing of their right to oppose making any automated individual decisions pursuant to article 22 of the GDPR, Relevant information on the implemented logic, Relevance and foreseen consequences of the relevant processing for the data subject";high

24;"Blocking constitutes an obligation of the data controller whose sole purpose is to provide a response to any possible liabilities arising from the data processing, for the purposes of obtaining evidence of any possible non-compliance and exclusively during their validity term";medium;definition
25;"Article 32 of LOPDGDD establishes blocked data as the status of data kept outside the processing scope, applying any technical or organizational measures that prevent any type of process, including visualization, except for the purposes of making such data available to the relevant courts or judges, the public prosecutor or the competent Public Administration";medium;definition
25;"The need to include the above measures to block any data related to the inference process (or at least inputs and results) which may be needed to respond a request or claim by the relevant data subject must be considered as a requirement when designing the processing";high
26;"Article 20 of the GDPR establishes that, when the processing is carried out by automated means the data subject has the right to request any data that has provided to the relevant controller, get it in an structured, common-use, machine-readable format, and to transfer it to another data controller";medium;definition
26;"As best practices, and beyond any requirement arising from data protection, human supervision may be an option which may be chosen within AI-based data processing, and in general with regard to automated decisions";high
26;"The 'dead man switch' approach must be avoided in system design: human users must have the option to ignore the algorithm at a given time in all cases, and to document the situations in which this course is privileged";high
28;"When processing personal data and it is proportionally to the processing activities, the organization must adopt a Data Protection Policy as established by article 24 of the GDPR";high
28;"GDPR lays down that such measures must be selected according a risk based approach (RBT) which specifically considers the risks posed by personal data processing and profiling with regard to their rights and liberties";high
28;"RBT includes two fundamental stages: a first stage consisting on identifying threats and assessing the existing inherent risk level, and a second stage consisting in managing this risk by means of appropriate and proportional technical and organizational measures in order to remove or at least mitigate such risk, with the purposes of reducing the probability of impact of the identified threat";high;definition
28;"Once the chosen measures have been implemented, the remaining residual risk must be assessed and controlled";high
28;"Any risks arising from the processing itself, in particular that derived from the bias present in decision-making systems and the natural persons discrimination (algorithmic discrimination)";medium;definition
28;"Any risks arising for processing with regard to social context and collateral effects which may be derived from the processing, even those that are indirectly related to the purpose of the processing";medium;definition
29;"The controller must be able of identifying any additional risk arising from the new AI component and its implementation";high
29;"The controller of the development, maintenance and/or release of an AI components, as well as the data controller of any processing including AI components, must implement the appropriate measures to minimise or remove such risk factors for each respective stages and responsibilities";high
29;"The PIA must be documented and, when a high residual risk is detected, it must be subject to consultation before the supervisory authority under the conditions established in Article 36 of the GDPR";high
30;"Minimising the amount of data that is being processed, both in terms of volume of information gathered and the size of the population that is the subject of the analysis, as well as throughout the different phases of the processing";high

30;"Improving the information for the data subjects, in terms of time and the specific channels, about the characteristics and the legal grounds for the processing, thus enhancing transparency and allowing the data subjects to adopt informed decisions on the processing of their data";high
30;"Providing means for the data subjects so that they can control the way their data are collected, processed, used and released to third parties by implementing mechanisms that are adapted to the level of risk that enables them to exert their rights in terms of data protection";high
30;"Complying with a privacy policy that is consistent with the legal obligations and requirements imposed by the regulation";high
30;"Proving, as the accountability principle states, that the data protection policy that is applicable is being fulfilled, as well as all other legal requirements and obligations imposed by the Regulation, with regard to the data subjects and the supervisory authorities";high
