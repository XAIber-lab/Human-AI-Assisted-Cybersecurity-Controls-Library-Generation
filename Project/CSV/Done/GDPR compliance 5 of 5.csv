41;"The controller shall be aware of the obligations and the limits established in the sectorial regulation, for such legal bases do not allow for the processing of personal data contained in the log file for different purposes such as the assessment of the performance or the evolution of the AI system. Therefore, the controller must ensure that guarantees are implemented to avoid access to and use of such record for purposes for which no legal grounds are available.";High
41;"The developers of the AI component whenever they are using ML-based solutions should implement other registers for the purposes of documenting and meeting the principle of accountability to allow a traceability of the origin of the training data and the validation of such data, as well as records of analysis performed on the validity of such data and the results thereof.";High
41;"The use of AI-based solutions sets the controllers and the processor on a position where the processing, by virtue of its characteristics, and, more precisely, by virtue of the technology chosen, may entail a high level or risk. Therefore, an assessment should be made on whether the object of the processing may not be achieved through the use of another type of solution with the same functionality, with an acceptable performance and a lesser risk.";High
41;"That is to say, the availability, or the novelty of a technology does not justify on itself the use of such a technology. Such technology must be subject to consideration, and an analysis must be carried out on whether the type of processing that is being proposed is a balanced solution. It should be assessed that the general interest and the society, as a whole, will get enough advantages and benefices as opposed to the disadvantages.";Medium
41;"THE SELECTION OF THE MOST SUITABLE OPTION TO MANAGE THE RISK MEANS THAT A COMPENSATION NEEDS TO BE OBTAINED OF THE COSTS AND THE EFFORTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION WITH REGARD TO THE ADVANTAGES THAT ARE BEING OBTAINED WHILE KEEPING INTO ACCOUNT THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS THE REGULATION REQUIREMENTS OR OTHERWISE, SUCH AS THE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE PROTECTION OF THE NATURAL BACKGROUND. THE DECISIONS SHALL ALSO BE ADOPTED WITH REGARD TO THE RISKS WHOSE PROCESSING IS NOT JUSTIFIABLE FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW, FOR EXAMPLE, SEVERE (HIGHLY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES) BUT RARE (LOW PROBABILITY) RISKS.";High
42;"Whenever we are dealing with personal data protection, the risks to be taken into account are the risks regarding the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. If it is the society who is undertaking such risks, the advantages obtained should not only be assessed from the entity's perspective, but rather from the point of view of the society within the scope were the processing is deployed.";High
42;"More precisely, in the event of processing using AI-based solutions in order to adopt decisions or to help adopt decisions, it is recommended that the PIA carries out a comparative analysis between the performance obtained by a qualified human operator and the output shown by models capable of forecasting scenarios or adopting decisions automatically";High
42;"The audit process on a processing including an AI component may have a different extent: audit on the development process of the component, on the releasing of the model, on specific aspects of the processing, on the operation, the security, the robustness against model attacks, etc.";Medium;definition
42;"As establishes by the principle of accountability, the guarantees established to manage the risk must be documented and collect enough information to enable a satisfactory and verifiable accreditation of the actions taken. Such documentation must enable the traceability of the decisions and verifications made pursuant to the minimisation principles referred above.";High

43;"The fulfilment of the limitations on automated decisions without a human intervention, the assessment, as the case may be, of the quality of the human intervention and the supervisory mechanisms adopted.";High
44;"A critical aspect of the audit is to guarantee that the AI-based solution is being used for the purpose for which it was designed, with special attention to its use by the operators of the system.";High
44;"The use of solutions or real-time automated audit tools is advisable in systems with automated decision-making in order to ensure that the output is consistent and precise, as well as in order to allow that erroneous decisions be aborted or cancelled before irreversible consequences arise.";High
44;"The development or deployment of an AI component based on Cloud services, the disclosure of user data to third parties in order to evolve the AI model or the release of the AI component in the event that personal data exist that are inherent to the model, may imply cross-border data flows to third countries.";Medium;definition
44;"The guarantees appearing in Chapter V of the GDPR 'Transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations' need to be applied to such transfers. It is especially important to establish mechanisms in order to allow the contracts signed in this context of international transfers to be managed smoothly, ensuring at the same time that the client, as data controller, has enough information on the contractors or prospect contractors and keeps the power to adopt decisions.";High
45;"Commercialization, for entities and consumers in general, of processing including solutions based on disruptive technologies, such as technologies based on AI components, requests for the implementation of quality and security guarantees like in every other product.";Medium
45;"The availability or novelty of a technology is not reason enough to commercialise products that do not meet a certain level of quality of service, especially when such requirements are laid down by regulation.";High
45;"With regard to the protection of personal data, compliance with the provisions in the GDPR requests a certain level of maturity in the AI solutions that makes it possible to objectively assess the compliance of the processing and the implementation of guarantees and measures to manage the risks.";High
45;"With regard to such risks, technology in general, and AI technologies in particular, may have a multiplying effect of the ethical deficiencies that are already present in society or those that are perpetuated from the past and are registered in historical data. The application of the GDPR and the guarantees it incorporates allows to minimise such risks.";Medium;definition
45;"The use of transparency, risk management strategies and audit and certification mechanisms will allow for compliance with the provisions in the GDPR but this will also enhance trust by users in AI-based products and services";High
45;"AI-applications may be a useful tool to implement guarantees to ensure data protection";Low;definition
45;"Finally, it must be highlighted that one of the main problems of AI-based solutions is not the AI itself, but rather the way in which the AI technology and the new psychological biases arising out of its use are going to be used by individuals. More precisely, careful attention needs to be paid so as not to assign responsibilities to unsupervised AI components without adopting a rational, critical and discerning position.";High
45;"The delegation of decision-making on machines is not something new; it has already been used with determinist algorithms, but the bias of assigning a kind of authority or reputability to a result just inferred by an AI-based solution may increase the risks arising out of such a delegation of responsibility.";Medium;definition
