32;"Critical functions are economic and social activities for which the interruption or disruption would have serious consequences. They include: 1) the health, safety, and security of citizens; 2) the effective functioning of services essential to the economy and society, and of the government; or 3) economic and social prosperity more broadly";Low;definition
33;"Operating and monitoring an AI system involves continuously assessing its recommendations and impacts (both intended and unintended) in light of the system's objectives as well as the ethical considerations that go into its operation. In this phase, problems are identified and adjustments made by reverting to other phases or, if necessary, retiring an AI system from production";High
34;"Transparent, accessible information about the AI system's objectives and assumptions: Provide interested stakeholders with access to useful information";High
34;"Performance monitoring mechanisms: Such as metrics to assess the performance and accuracy of the AI system";High
34;"Tools or processes for developing or maintaining trustworthy AI: Using tools like guidelines; governance frameworks; product development or lifecycle tools including for model robustness; risk management frameworks; sector-specific codes of conduct; process standards; technical validation approaches; technical documentation; technical standards; toolkits, toolboxes or software tools; educational material; change-management processes; certification (technical and/or process-related); or tools for protection against adverse attacks";High
34;"Key actors in the Economic Context dimension are often AI system operators who plan and design the AI system and, following deployment, operate and monitor it. System operators relate to accountability; transparency and explainability; and safety, security and robustness";Medium;definition
38;"Identified data: Data that can be unambiguously associated with a specific person because they contain personal identifiable information";Medium;definition
38;"Pseudonymised data: Data for which all personal identifiers are substituted by aliases. The alias assignment is such that it cannot be reversed by reasonable efforts, except for the party that performed the assignment";Medium;definition
38;"Unlinked pseudonymised data: Data for which all personal identifiers are irreversibly erased or substituted by aliases. The linkage cannot be re-established by reasonable efforts, including by the party that performed the assignment";Medium;definition
38;"Data identifiability can help assess the level of risk to privacy and inform the need for legal and technical protection and access control";High
39;"Anonymised data: Data that are not linked to attributes that can be altered (i.e. attributes' values are randomised or generalised) in such a way that there is a reasonable level of confidence that a person cannot be identified, directly or indirectly, by the data alone or in combination with other data";Medium;definition
39;"Data appropriateness: Data are appropriate for the purpose for which they are to be used, following standard practice in the industry sector";High
39;"Sample representativeness: Selected variables and training or evaluation data accurately depict/reflect the population in the AI system environment";High
39;"Adequate sample size: Sample size displays an appropriate level of granularity, coverage and sufficiency of data";High
39;"Completeness and coherence of sample: Sample is complete, with minimal missing or partial values. Outliers must not affect the quality of data";High
39;"Low data noise: Data is infrequently incorrect, corrupted or distorted";High
39;"Data appropriateness impacts the accuracy and reliability of the outcome of AI systems and relates to their robustness, security and safety";High
39;"The use of inappropriate data/input in an AI system can lead to erroneous and possibly dangerous conclusions";Medium
39;"Data quality has important policy implications for human rights and fairness, as well as to the robustness and safety of an AI system: from both fairness and robustness perspectives, datasets must be inclusive, diverse and representative so they do not misrepresent specific (sub) groups";High
