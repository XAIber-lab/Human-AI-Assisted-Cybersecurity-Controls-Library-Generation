11;"The life cycle of an AI-based component can be broken into several phases: design and analysis, development (which includes research, selection, analysis and data cleansing, prototyping, design, training, testing, implementation in software and/or hardware, integration as part of a global processing and validation), operations and maintenance (including evolutionary maintenance) or final disposal.";High
11;"Within the vast range of quality audits, both process and product audits can be carried out. The goal of the relevant audit may be to ensure compliance with personal data regulations and thus prevent situations of non-compliance. In the same way, potential risks associated with the use of personal data in AI-based components can be identified, anticipated and corrected.";High
12;"A risk analysis of the process must be focused in identifying those aspects which may have an impact on achieving the desired control objectives and which shall be related to planning, available resources, audit team, control of documented information, availability and cooperation of persons in charge, the conditions regarding both the AI-based component itself and its context, monitoring and revised procedures related to the designed audit plan, legal and administrative issues and any other circumstances.";High
12;"For example, in case of a component which, based on an analysis of input data, makes decisions which may significantly affect a person, denying him or her access to essential services or restricting his or her freedoms, obviously the scope of the corresponding audit and the degree of exhaustivity when analysing the proposed controls must be higher than would be for a component whose function is, for example, limited to classifying certain e-mails in the Spam folder.";Medium
13;"Both the code and any additional files defined by the version must include a digital signature over the entire package to guarantee its integrity.";High
13;"A version history of the evolution of the AI component used must be available and documented. It will include the parameters used in the training of the component and everything that ensures the traceability of the evolution/changes in the component.";High

14;"The logic of the relevant AI-based component is well documented so it can be understood. Its behaviour regarding input data sets, data use, intermediate data and output data can be traced.";High
14;"If an erroneous behaviour of the AI-based component can cause harm to data subjects, mechanisms have been established to minimise such damage, provide communication channels to relevant stakeholders and facilitate communication among all stakeholders involved in the process.";High
15;"The requirements applicable to human operators in charge of supervising and interpreting the operation of the AI-based component must be defined.";High
15;"When appropriate, interaction between the AI-based component with other own or third-party components, systems or applications, and the distribution of responsibilities for maintenance, updating and minimising system privacy issues must be documented.";High
16;"When addressing a new issue, the motivations and grounds for addressing this issue by using an AI-based component must be documented.";Medium
16;"The risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects introduced by using an AI-based component in data processing must be analysed and managed.";High
16;"Information obligation to data subjects with regard to data processing arising from the inclusion of the AI-based component are identified.";High
17;"The legal grounds to store personal data used by the AI-based component for a period of time that exceeds the period established for processing purposes must be duly identified";High
17;"Appropriate technical and organizational measures and criteria must have been defined to storage personal data";High
17;"The time limits for erasure of stored personal data must have been defined.";High
18;"A storage policy has been defined for personal data included in the activity records of the AI-based component and privacy strategies (minimisation, hiding, separation or abstraction) must be implemented for operation purposes.";High
18;"The categories of data subjects affected by the development of the AI component and its use in the framework of the intended processing are identified.";Medium
18;"The necessary procedures have been defined to analyse the social context in which the AI component is used, and to collect information from people, groups or organizations affected by such AI component for the purposes of knowing their levels of satisfaction, position, concerns and uncertainties regarding the application of this technique for processing their data.";High
19;"Documents with development policies of products and systems must consider the data protection policy.";Medium
19;"The Data Protection Officer must have the necessary professional qualifications and, particularly, the legal and technical expertise, as well as data protection practice appropriate to the project.";High
19;"The Data Protection Officer is assisted and advised by experts on specific matters relating to the AI component being audited.";Medium
19;"Internal procedures must have been defined within the organisation for correct communication between the Data Protection Officers and the people in charge of those projects that may have an impact in data processing";High
20;"A procedure has been established for the critical and verified revision of the reasoning arising from acceptance of important hypotheses for the development of the AI-based component";High
20;"The methodological framework for defining the model and creating the AI component in the audited stages, such as the methods for selecting, collecting and preparing component's training data, labelling, model building, using intermediate data, selecting the test/validation data subset or measuring deviations for improvement purposes, must be duly documented.";High
20;"The metrics for measuring the behaviour of the AI component have been selected and measured.";High
