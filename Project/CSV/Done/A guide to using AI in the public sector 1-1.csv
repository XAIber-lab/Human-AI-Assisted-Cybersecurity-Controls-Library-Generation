page 14;it's ethical and safe to use the data - refer to the Data Ethics Framework
page 14;you have a the right sort of data for the AI model to learn from
page 16;For your AI model to work, it often needs access to a large quantity of data, and more importantly the right kind of data
page 16;You can assess whether your data is high enough quality for AI using a combination of: accuracy; completeness; uniqueness; timeliness; validity; sufficiency; relevancy; representativeness; consistency
page 16;If your problem involves supporting an ongoing business decision process, you will need to plan to establish ongoing, up-to-date access to data
