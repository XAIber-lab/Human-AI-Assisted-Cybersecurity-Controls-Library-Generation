14-15;"With regard to their capacity to comply with processing requirements, all technical solutions share certain parameters which must be specified, such as: Accuracy, precision or error rates required by the relevant processing, Data input quality requirements to the AI component, Precision, accuracy or effective error rates of the AI-based solution depending on the appropriate metrics to measure the eligibility of such AI-based solution, Convergence of the model when training or evolve the IA-solution, Consistency in the results of the inference process, Algorithm predictability";high
15;"The GDPR is developed around six principles: 1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency 2. Purpose limitation (purpose specification) 3. Data minimisation 4. Accuracy 5. Storage limitation 6. Integrity and confidentiality";medium;definition

19;"There is a minimum set of terms and conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to guarantee that the processing is compliant, including: Grounds for a legitimate personal data processing, Obligation to inform data subjects and to be transparent in this respect, Obligation to provide data subjects with mechanisms to exercise their rights, Application of the principle of accountability, Compliance with all terms and conditions to carry out international data transfers";high
