page 12;accountability - consider who is responsible for each element of the model's output and how the designers and implementers of AI systems will be held accountable
page 12;explainability and transparency - so the affected stakeholders can know how the AI model reached its decision
page 12;data quality - the success of your AI project depends on the quality of your data
page 12;fairness - are the models trained and tested on relevant, accurate, and generalisable datasets and is the AI system deployed by users trained to implement them responsibly and without bias
page 13;You'll need to make sure your AI system is compliant with GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018), including the points which relate to automated decision making
page 13;specific and easily accessible information about the automated decision-making process
page 13;You should consider both the final decision and any automated decisions which significantly affected the decision-making process
page 15;specialists who have a good knowledge of your data and the problem you're trying to solve, such as data scientists
page 15;at least one domain knowledge expert who knows the environment where you will be deploying the AI model results
page 16;For your AI model to work, it often needs access to a large quantity of data, and more importantly the right kind of data
page 16;Work with specialists who have the knowledge of your data, such as data scientists, to assess your data state
page 16;You can assess whether your data is high enough quality for AI using a combination of: accuracy; completeness; uniqueness; timeliness; validity; sufficiency; relevancy; representativeness; consistency
page 16;If your problem involves supporting an ongoing business decision process, you will need to plan to establish ongoing, up-to-date access to data
