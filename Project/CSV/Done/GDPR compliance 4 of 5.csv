31;"The principle of transparency is explained in Recital 39 and Recital 58. The obligation to inform data subjects is understood in such Recitals in a way that extends beyond the provisions in Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR. More precisely, the Recitals state the obligation in the sense that 'any information and communication relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand' 'concise', 'that clear and plain language be used' 'where appropriate, visualisation be used', 'that it be provided electronically', 'that further information to ensure fair and transparent processing' be provided";High
31;"data subjects should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data";High
31;"In the case of AI-based processing, transparency may be considered a critical aspect, then, it must enable data subjects to become aware of the impact of such solutions";High
31;"Transparency is addressed both to data subjects and to processing operators. More precisely, transparency is linked to an accurate information on the efficiency, the real capabilities and the real limitations of the AI systems to avoid false expectations among users and data subjects";High
31;"During training, if personal data are used, the data subject must be clearly informed on the possibility that such data be reidentifiable from the data of a model, or, as established in Article 11.2 of the GDPR, that such reidentification not be possible";High
32;"Data controllers adopting this type of solutions and systems must provide precise information and specific training to their personnel on the limitations of the AI system";High
32;"At the time to operate the system, it is necessary to offer real-time information to the operator on the accuracy values and/or quality values of the information inferred at each time";High
32;"when the information inferred does not reach the minimum quality thresholds, it must be explicitly noticed that such information is not valid or that it has no value";High
33;"With regard to the need for inferred data on data subjects to be accurate, there are three factors that may affect such accuracy: The very implementation of the AI system, The training or validation dataset is corrupted by errors, Biased evolution of the AI model";Medium, definition
34;"The accuracy is particularly critical when the processing is based on biometric information, such as AI on face recognition, fingerprints, voice, etc";Medium
34;"The controller must take into account that, even if such users may be a minority, alternative mechanisms must be put into place in order to avoid exclusion of a subject on the grounds that the AI solution is unable of capturing the biometric characteristics of the data subjects";High
36;"Minimisation is the process of optimising the processing from the point of view of data protection, analysing the needs of the data processing in the different phases of the process";Medium, definition
36;"Limiting the extent of the data categories that are used in each phase of the processing to categories that are strictly necessary and relevant";High
36;"Limiting the level of detail or precision of the information, the granularity of the collection in terms of time and frequency and the collection date of the information used";High
36;"Limiting the extent of the number of data subjects whose data are being processed";High
36;"Limiting accessibility to the several data categories to the controller's/ processor's personnel or even to the final user";High
39;"The GDPR established in Article 32 that both the controller and the processor shall apply suitable technical and organisational measures to guarantee a suitable security level with regard to the data subjects' rights and freedoms";High
39;"Apart from the analysis of the security measures that are common to any system there are specific guarantees for AI-based processing";Medium
39-40;"Among the different security measures, it is advisable to pay careful attention to those managing the following types of threats: Access and manipulation of the training dataset, Inclusion of Trojans and backdoors during the development of the AI, Manipulation of the user API, Attacks by 'adversarial machine learning', Attacks through pattern imitation, Reidentification of the personal data included within the model, Fraud or deceive to the AI by data subjects, Leak to third parties of the profiling results or the decisions inferred by the AI, Leak or access to the logs";High
40;"The log files shall provide evidence in order to: Establish who and under what circumstances accesses the personal data that may be included within the model, Provide traceability with regard to the update of the inference models, the communications of the user API with the model and the detection of abuse or intrusion attempts, Provide traceability to enable governance in data disclosure among all intervening parties in the AI-based solution";High
34-35;"The tests and/or verification of a AI component is a fundamental part in the development of such component, as well as an important criterion for the controller to opt for one component or another from other developer. The controller must take into account that the inclusion of a verified AI component in a processing does not guarantee that the processing is validated and neither confirms the AI component's adequacy for such specific processing";High
35;"The tests of the AI component guarantee that the design and development results comply with the requirements of the component. The scope of the validation of the processing extends even further. It should garantee that the resulting products and services meet the requirements regarding a specific application or envisaged use";High
35;"The validation of the processing including an AI component must be performed under conditions reflecting the real context where the processing is expected to be deployed";High
35;"the validation process requires a periodic review, taking into account that such context or the processing itself could change and evolve";High
31;"Transparency is not limited to a one moment or flahs, but rather it must be understood as a principle around which the processing to be carried out and affecting each and every element and stakeholder of the processing";Medium, definition
32;"The appointment of a DPO is one of the best measures that may be adopted by the controller to orientate the implementation of transparency policies";High
32;"Both Article 37.1 of the GDPR and Article 34 of LOPDGDD la down the conditions that make compulsory for the controller/processor to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) by virtue of the nature of the processing or by virtue of the type of activity";Medium, definition
32;"The fact of using an AI solution does not imply, per se, that there is an obligation for a DPO";Low, definition
32;"the DPO is a key element to guarantee the fulfilment and the management of risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects";Medium
40;"The existence of log files or activity records, the performance of audits (be they automated or manual) and the certification of the process are inherent to the 'accountability' strategies or proactive responsibility strategies";High
