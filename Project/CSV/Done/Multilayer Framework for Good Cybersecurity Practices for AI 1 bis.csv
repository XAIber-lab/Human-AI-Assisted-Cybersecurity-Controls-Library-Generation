4;"to develop a framework for AI good cybersecurity practices (FAICP) necessary for securing the ICT infrastructures and the hosted AI, taking into account the AI life cycle which goes beyond ML (from system concept to decommissioning) and all elements of the AI supply chain, associated actors, processes and technologies";Medium;Definition
8;"Cybersecurity of an ICT infrastructure should cover the following dimensions (also known as 'CIA'): confidentiality, integrity/authenticity and availability/non-repudiation for all six blocks and all assets within the layers of the ICT infrastructure";High;
8;"The various types of threats to ICT infrastructures are listed below: Adversarial threats - These pose malicious intentions (e.g. denial of service attacks, non-authorised access, masquerading of identity) to individuals, groups, organisations or nations; Accidental threats - These are caused accidentally or through legitimate components. Human errors are a typical accidental threat; Environmental threats - These include natural disasters (floods, earthquakes), human-caused disasters (fire, explosions) and failures of supporting infrastructures (power outage, communication loss); Vulnerability - This is an existing weakness that might be exploited by an attacker";High;Definition
8-9;"For the identification of general cybersecurity threats, AI stakeholders wishing to secure their ICT infrastructure can use the annual ENISA Threat Landscape report on the state of the cybersecurity threat landscape, or similar reports such as the annual technical threat reports published by other organisations";High;
9;"Security management includes two main phases: Risk analysis - Threat/vulnerability/impact analyses and risk estimations are conducted on all assets within the perimeter of the assessment (e.g. components of medical devices, cyber assets within a hospital's infrastructure); Risk management - Risks are treated by selecting and implementing appropriate countermeasures";High;
9;"The appropriate selection of controls requires a cost-benefit analysis, to determine the risks the manufacturer is willing to accept and compare the costs of those risks against the benefits";High;
9;"The major focus lies on enterprises and the identification, analysis and evaluation of threats and vulnerabilities, along with the estimation of risk levels to the respective enterprise assets. The outcome of a risk analysis is a list of threats to all assets of the enterprise ICT system, together with the corresponding risk levels of these threats to all assets";High;
7;"Layer I (cybersecurity foundations). The basic cybersecurity knowledge and practices that need to be applied to all ICT environments that host/operate/develop/integrate/maintain/supply/provide AI systems";Medium;Definition
7;"Layer II (AI-specific). Cybersecurity practices needed for addressing the specificities of the AI components with a view on their life cycle, properties, threats and security controls";Medium;Definition
7;"Layer III (Sectoral AI). Various best practices that can be used by the sectoral stakeholders to secure their AI systems. High-risk AI systems (i.e. those that process personal data) have been identified in the AI Act";Medium;Definition
8;"The components of any ICT infrastructure can be viewed as a scalable pyramid of six building blocks: Infrastructure, Telecom, IT applications and technologies, Domain/sectoral e/m-services, Data and data processes, Users/procedures";Low;Definition
