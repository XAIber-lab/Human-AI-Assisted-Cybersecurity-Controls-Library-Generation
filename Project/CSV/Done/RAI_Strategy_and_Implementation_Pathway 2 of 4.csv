page 9;Ensure disciplined governance structure and processes at the Component and DoD-wide levels for oversight and accountability and clearly articulate DoD guidelines and policies on RAI and associated incentives to accelerate adoption of RAI within the DoD.;Medium
page 9;Governance structures and processes will enable the appropriate assessment of risks and the mitigation of unintended consequences or bias in AI capabilities.;High
page 9;Ensure warfighter trust by providing education and training, establishing a test and evaluation and verification and validation (TEVV) framework that integrates real-time monitoring, algorithm confidence metrics, and user feedback to ensure trusted and trustworthy AI capabilities.;High
page 9;Trustworthiness is bolstered by the application of TEVV frameworks that allow for the monitoring of system performance, reliability, unintended behavior, and failure modes before fielding the system and during operation.;High
page 10;Exercise appropriate care in the Al product and acquisition lifecycle to ensure potential Al risks are considered from the outset of an Al project, and efforts are taken to mitigate or ameliorate such risks and reduce the likelihood of unintended consequences;High
page 10;Use the requirements validation process to ensure that capabilities that leverage AI are aligned with operational needs while addressing relevant Al risks. System performance requirements validation increases the reliability and safety of systems prior to and during deployment.;High

page 15;All DoD Components must ensure that their Al capabilities are in alignment with the DoD Ethical Principles, and that their policies and practices enable RAI implementation.;Low
page 16;Due to continuous advancements in Al research and the dynamic nature of emerging Al strategies, an approach to ATdevelopment that incorporates existing risk management best practices affords the DoD the flexibility to leverage cutting-edge technology while adhering to our standards for safety, reliability, and ethics.;High
page 16;This includes the continuous identification, evaluation, and mitigation of risks- including risks from inaction or opportunity costs-across the entire product lifecycle and well beyond deployment.;High
page 16;Data and model documentation, product risk reviews, and post-deployment monitoring and training are critical factors of RAI; however, the level of attention and risk mitigation efforts must be scalable based on the level of technical maturity, sensitivity, or risk associated with AI projects.;High
page 16;DoD Components will identify the resources as well as the appropriate manpower- personnel, expertise, and experience-to carry out fully the RAI activities identified in this Pathway.;Medium
