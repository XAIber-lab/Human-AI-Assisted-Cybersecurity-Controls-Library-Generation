4;"Safeguarding fairness and rights to nondiscrimination"
4;"For example, a hiring algorithm used by Amazon to screen résumés scored the applications of men higher than those of women—including by downgrading résumés that contained words like "women's" and degrees from all-female colleges."
4;"Therefore, designing fair algorithms is more important than ever. One of the challenges in making AI systems fair lies in deciding how to make mathematically tractable the ideal of "fairness.""
4;"While there has been much research on how to quantitatively evaluate fairness, there is no general consensus. The problem is twofold. First, defining fairness is not an easy task—there can be multiple reasonable conceptions of fairness."
4;"Where there is no singular definition of fairness, AI systems designed to maintain the status quo—as the COMPAS algorithm is set up to do—have the potential to perpetuate and exacerbate inequality. Therefore, to build fair AI systems, we need to define and quantify what we mean by a fair outcome—that is, truly equal access to resources at the beginning and attention to the backend impacts, whether or not there were claims a process was "fair.""
4;"Identify fairness considerations and approaches up-front, and involve multi-stakeholders, such as experts in the relevant domain and across disciplines, in the conversation."
4;"Explore a legally viable path for algorithmic fairness under current constitutional doctrines."
4;"Develop testing and monitoring mechanisms to detect and mitigate fairness-related harms."
6;"Implement bias and safety bug-bounty programs, allowing individuals to report algorithmic bias or security vulnerabilities to an organization and receive rewards or compensation, for AI systems to increase incentives for broader scrutiny of AI systems."
9;"Build AI themes, including AI ethics and the technology's impact on society, into Department of Education recommendations on technology and CS education."
9;"It must be done, however, with substantial focus on technology ethics—something missing in many current CS education programs—and in this case, with a focus on the ethics of designing, developing, and deploying AI and biometrics systems. This should include understanding the ethical implications of these technologies, the ethical frameworks and policies in place around their development, and what future ethics should look like, from engineers to regulators."
