The CRISP-DM model is useful here. IBM's Scaled Data Science Method, an extension of CRISP-DM, offers governance across the AI model lifecycle informed by collaborative input from data scientists, industrial-organizational psychologists, designers, communication specialists and others. The method merges best practices in data science, project management, design frameworks and AI governance. Teams can easily see and understand the requirements at each stage of the lifecycle, including documentation, who they need to talk to or collaborate with, and next steps."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to safe and secure use, develop, and provision of a system and an AI system.;3;"Establishing a center of excellence to give diverse, multidisciplinary teams a community for applied training to identify potential disparate impact."
List every action, recommendation, best practice, guidelines, tip, norm and standard related to safe and secure use, develop, and provision of a system and an AI system.;3;"Using auditing tools to reflect the bias exhibited in models. If the reflection aligns with the values of the organization, transparency surrounding the chosen data and methods is key. If the reflection does not align with organizational values, then this is a signal that something must change. Discovering and mitigating potential disparate impact caused by bias involves far more than examining the data the model was trained on. Organizations must also examine people and processes involved. For example, have appropriate and inappropriate uses of the model been clearly communicated?"
