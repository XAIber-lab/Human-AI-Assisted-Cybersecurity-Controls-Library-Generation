10;"actors need to govern and manage risks throughout their AI systems' lifecycle – from planning and design, to data collection and processing, to model building and validation, to deployment, operation and monitoring";high
10;"Defining the scope, context, actors and criteria to evaluate is the first step to managing an AI system's risks, which differ depending on the use case and the circumstances";high
10;"analysing trade-offs is key to unlocking AI benefits while managing risks and it is also important to consider AI risks against the risks of not using AI in contexts where it can provide key insights";medium
10;"Assessing AI risks and impacts means identifying, evaluating and measuring the risks that could affect an AI system's ability to function as intended and in a trustworthy manner";high
10;"Treating the risks should be commensurate to their potential adverse impacts";high
10;"Responses can be technical, such as implementing privacy-preserving machine learning frameworks or de-identifying training data, or process-related, such as requiring documentation of AI model or training data characteristics or ensuring conformity with safety regulations";high
10;"For risks that cause adverse impacts, redress mechanisms and remedial actions may be required";medium
10;"Monitoring and reviewing is an continual process taking into account the evolving nature of some AI systems and the environments in which they operate";high
10;"Examining an AI system's context and scope also includes understanding how the system is developed and maintained, including whether a system is built in-house or by a third party";medium
10;"AI actors must take measures ensure their AI systems are trustworthy – i.e. that they benefit people; respect human rights and fairness; are transparent and explainable; and are robust, secure and safe";medium
10;"Several tools can help assess risks, such as tools to indicate system transparency, detect bias, identify privacy violations and assess a system's security and robustness";high
