4;"These Principles complement DoD's existing framework by offering AI-specific guidance and seeking to outline appropriate safeguards for a technology that continues to be subject to rapid developments";low
4;"The DoD was the first military in the world to publish AI ethics principles and continues to lead in the promotion of global AI standards and norms through the implementation of RAI";low
5;"DoD personnel will exercise appropriate levels of judgment and care, while remaining responsible for the development, deployment, and use of AI capabilities";medium
5;"The Department will take deliberate steps to minimize unintended bias in AI capabilities";medium
5;"The Department's AI capabilities will be developed and deployed such that relevant personnel possess an appropriate understanding of the technology, development processes, and operational methods applicable to AI capabilities, including with transparent and auditable methodologies, data sources, and design procedures and documentation";high
5;"The Department's AI capabilities will have explicit, well-defined uses, and the safety, security, and effectiveness of such capabilities will be subject to testing and assurance within those defined uses across their entire life-cycles";high
5;"The Department will design and engineer AI capabilities to fulfill their intended functions while possessing the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences, and the ability to disengage or deactivate deployed systems that demonstrate unintended behavior";high
6;"RAI manifests itself in ethical guidelines, testing standards, accountability checks, employment guidance, human systems integration, and safety considerations";medium
6;"RAI emphasizes the necessity for technical maturity to build effective, resilient, robust, reliable, and explainable AI, while recognizing the value of multidisciplinary teams to advise on ethics, accountability, and risk";medium
6;"RAI centers around continuous oversight, moving beyond traditional performance metrics to include the aspects of workforce, culture, organization, and governance that affect how AI is implemented throughout the product lifecycle";high
7;"Assessing ethical impacts of employing AI technology, along with evaluations on the trustworthiness of AI systems results in thoroughly tested and justifiably trusted systems";medium
7;"a comprehensive risk management approach will be employed that addresses system-level, institutional, and socio-technical risks. This provides for multidimensional and contextual assessment of risk in the design, deployment, development, and use of AI capabilities across a wide range of scenarios";high
