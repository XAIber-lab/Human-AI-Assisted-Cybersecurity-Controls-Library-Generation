5,"Industry and consumer protection organizations support a risk-based approach. U.S.-Japan Business Council has stated that "any efforts by the two governments in this area should be mindful of existing rules and regulations, incorporate risk-based approaches to AI governance ...""
6,"A risk-based approach or idea that the degree of regulatory intervention should be proportionate to the impact of risks for AI governance is very much an international common ground. The European Commission stated in the AI White Paper that "the Commission is of the view that it should follow a risk-based approach" because "the new regulatory framework for AI should be effective to achieve its objectives while not being excessively prescriptive.""
6,"In the United States, when considering regulation, agencies are to take a risk-based approach and determine which risks are acceptable while considering potential benefits, and they think "it is not necessary to mitigate every foreseeable risk" and do not favor prescriptive regulations."
7,"Some issues are revolving around the assessment and classification of risk. First, how to classify AI risks is discussed and proposed. The AI White Paper by the European Commission takes a binary approach, where, on one hand, high-risk AI should be under legally binding regulations and on the other hand, non-high-risk AI should not be subject to such regulations."
7,"In contrast, the Data Ethics Commission, which the German federal government set up and gave a one-year mandate, classified AI risks into five levels and proposed a general regulatory approach to each level."
7,"Another perspective is classification by usage. The University of Vienna, the University of Freiburg, and the European Law Institute classify AI risks into (1) the physical dimension of risks such as death, injury and damage to property caused by unsafe products and activities and (2) the social dimension of risks such as discrimination, manipulation, exploitation, etc. and general loss of control caused by inappropriate decisions and the exercise of power based on AI and discuss how to regulate them."
8,"In addition to the abstract and theoretical analyses like the above, there is also case-specific risk analysis. The Center for Data Ethics and Innovation, established in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in the UK government, published a report titled "AI Barometer." The report evaluates various risks including bias leading to discrimination, lack of explainability, higher-impact cyberattacks, lack of transparency, and erosion of privacy in criminal justice, financial services, health and social care, digital and social media and energy and utilities, and then classifies them into three levels: higher, medium and low risk."
3,"Chapter 3 discusses ideal approaches to AI governance in Japan by taking domestic and international AI trends into account. First, relying on an approach guided by the Governance Model Study Group and other suggestions, it discusses AI governance generally required in the era of Society 5.0. Then, it discusses ideal approaches to AI governance based on stakeholders' opinions, including those of the members of the Expert Group. Based on the above discussion, it proposes the AI governance architecture that is ideal in Japan at the moment. Finally, it shows some issues that have not been fully discussed by the Expert Group."
5,"Rule-making. Shift from rule-based regulations that specify detailed duties of conduct to goal-based regulations that specify value to be attained ultimately, in order to overcome the problem of laws not being able to accommodate the speed and complexity of society. Establish non-binding guidelines and standards with a wide range of stakeholders so that they can achieve the goals. Continuously evaluate the effects and impacts of guidelines/standards, and arrange opportunities for frequent reviews by referring to data collected during monitoring and the claims of parties involved in the enforcement phase."
5,"Compliance/monitoring. Encourage businesses to take innovative approaches to achieving goals provided by laws (compliance), and focus on accountability for their activities (comply and explain). Further, in order to maintain public trust, utilize various forms of assurance depending on the risk, such as self-check, peer review, internal audit, agreed procedures, third-party review and external audit. Consider technologies and mechanisms that enable each stakeholder, such as businesses, the government and individuals, to access real-time data and conduct efficient and effective monitoring. Conduct "monitoring and reviews" by stakeholders on a regular basis, in order to evaluate the results of monitoring among stakeholders, which will lead to the revision of rules and improvement of systems."
