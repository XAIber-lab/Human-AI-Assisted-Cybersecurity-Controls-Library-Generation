10,"Several countries provide measures to encourage respect for AI principles. These measures can be generally divided into two categories: a commentary approach that explains each AI principle and an integration approach that intertwines AI principles with practices by companies and other entities."
11,"The Model Framework briefly explains principles underlying the framework at the beginning and then provides practical issues to be considered using practical examples from four perspectives: internal governance structures and measures, determining the level of human involvement in AI-augmented decision-making, operations management and stakeholder interaction and communication."
12,"The guidance provides a different guide for Data Protection Officers and compliance teams, technical teams and senior management. The guidance sets forth the following principles: be transparent, be accountable, consider the context you are operating in and reflect on the impact of your AI systems on the individuals affected, as well as wider society."
13,"Article 9 of the AI regulation proposal requires the establishment or implementation of a risk management system for high-risk AI systems, but even before this proposal from the European Commission, an AI management system has been discussed such as in ISO/IEC AWI 42001."
13,"The relevance and representativeness of datasets for training, validation, and testing as required by Article 10 are considered related to the following sections of the Machine Learning Quality Management Guideline of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (hereinafter referred to as "AIST"): A-1 (sufficiency of analysis of problem areas), A-2 (coverage for distinguished problem cases), and B-1 (coverage of test datasets)."
13,"Since the appropriate robustness level required in Article 15 can be satisfied using technical redundancy measures such as a fail-safe plan, it is considered mostly compatible with the criterion for avoiding quality incidents, which is a system quality criterion that is being recommended in the Guidelines for Quality Assurance for Artificial-Intelligence-based Products and Services starting with its May 2019 edition."
15,"In Japan, no person except a medical practitioner shall engage in medical practice under Article 17 of Medical Practitionersʼ Act, which requires a medical practitioner, who plays a responsible role in medical diagnosis, treatment, etc., to be responsible for the final decision even if AI is used in the medical care."
16,"The European Commissionʼs AI regulation proposal classifies asylum, migration, and border control management to be one of the high-risk AI system categories, and stipulates several specific usages as high risk."
16,"The UK government published the Data Ethics Framework for appropriate and responsible data use in government and other areas of the public sector in June 2018 and then, for the purpose of complementing the Data Ethics Framework, the Alan Turing Institute published Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety for the public sector."
16,"The UK government published a guide to using artificial intelligence in the public sector, which comprises a set of guidance on understanding AI, assessing whether AI is the right solution, planning and preparing for AI implementation and managing AI projects for the public sector."
16,"Canada stipulated Directive on Automated Decision-Making and made it effective in April 2020 to ensure that Automated Decision Systems are deployed in a manner that reduces risks to Canadians and federal institutions, and lead to more efficient, accurate, consistent, and interpretable decisions made pursuant to Canadian law."
17,"The Directive requires algorithmic impact assessment, ensuring transparency, quality assurance, providing opportunities for objection, and reporting on the effectiveness."
17,"In Japan, Advisors to Government Chief Information Officer, et al. have discussed issues to be considered and basic approaches required in AI systems, when AI is used in the government information systems or services by the government, for example, the transparency of training data, elimination of bias, history of data processing and issue of rights, those issues being taken into account in light of the level of risks."
18,"In the AI regulation proposal of the European Commission, this is reflected as an obligation on the part of high-risk AI system providers to cooperate with authorities by providing documents that prove compliance as requested by the authorities. In this proposal, the said providers are also required to establish and document a post-market monitoring system, and report any serious incidents to market surveillance authorities."
18,"Governance Model Study Group proposes a mechanism to facilitate a company to explain that they make efforts towards goals, to encourage them to improve their efforts through feedback from stakeholders including the government and reinforce mutual trust among companies, users and the government in society."
18,"The White Paper also states that "effective judicial redress for parties negatively affected by AI systems should be ensured,""
18,"Furthermore, the European Commissionʼs AI regulation proposal also provisions market monitoring and penal regulations by authorities. This aims at ensuring what is required by law through governmental power."
