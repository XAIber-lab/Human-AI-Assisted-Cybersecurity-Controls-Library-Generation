Page 1;Implement a comprehensive risk management framework proportionate to the nature and risk profile of activities. This includes establishing policies, procedures, and training to ensure that staff are familiar with their duties and the organization's risk management practices.;High
Page 1;Share information and best practices on risk management with firms playing complementary roles in the ecosystem.;High
Page 1;Employ multiple lines of defence, including conducting third-party audits prior to release.;High
Page 1;Perform a comprehensive assessment of reasonably foreseeable potential adverse impacts, including risks associated with inappropriate or malicious use of the system.;High
Page 1;Implement proportionate measures to mitigate risks of harm, such as by creating safeguards against malicious use.;High
Page 1;Make available to downstream developers and managers guidance on appropriate system usage, including information on measures taken to address risks.;High
Page 1;Assess and curate datasets used for training to manage data quality and potential biases.;Medium
Page 1;Implement diverse testing methods and measures to assess and mitigate risk of biased output prior to release.;High
Page 1;Publish information on capabilities and limitations of the system.;High
Page 1;Develop and implement a reliable and freely available method to detect content generated by the system, with a near-term focus on audio-visual content (e.g., watermarking).;Medium
Page 1;Publish a description of the types of training data used to develop the system, as well as measures taken to identify and mitigate risks.;High
Page 1;Ensure that systems that could be mistaken for humans are clearly and prominently identified as AI systems.;High
Page 1;Monitor the operation of the system for harmful uses or impacts after it is made available, including through the use of third-party feedback channels, and inform the developer and/or implement usage controls as needed to mitigate harm.;High
Page 1;Maintain a database of reported incidents after deployment, and provide updates as needed to ensure effective mitigation measures.;High
Page 1;Use a wide variety of testing methods across a spectrum of tasks and contexts prior to deployment to measure performance and ensure robustness.;High
Page 1;Employ adversarial testing (i.e., red-teaming) to identify vulnerabilities.;High
Page 1;Perform an assessment of cyber-security risk and implement proportionate measures to mitigate risks, including with regard to data poisoning.;High
Page 1;Perform benchmarking to measure the model's performance against recognized standards.;High
Page 1;Advanced AI systems capable of generating content — such as ChatGPT, DALL·E 2, and Midjourney — have captured the world's attention. The general-purpose capabilities of these advanced AI systems offer enormous potential for innovation in a number of fields, and they are already being adopted and put to use in a variety of contexts.;Low
Page 1;While they have many benefits, advanced generative AI systems also carry a distinctly broad risk profile, due to the broad scope of data on which they are trained, their wide range of potential uses, and the scale of their deployment.;Medium
Page 1;Systems that are made publicly available for a range of different uses can present risks to health and safety, can propagate bias, and carry the potential for broader societal impacts, particularly when used by malicious actors.;Medium
Page 1;These systems may also have important implications for individual privacy rights, as highlighted in the G7 Data Protection and Privacy Authorities' Statement on Generative AI.;Low
Page 1;To address and mitigate these risks, signatories to this code commit to adopting the identified measures.;Medium
Page 1;While the framework outlined here is specific to advanced generative AI systems, many of the measures are broadly applicable to a range of high-impact AI systems and can be readily adapted by firms working across Canada's AI ecosystem.;Low
Page 1;It is also important to note that this code does not in any way change existing legal obligations that firms may have – for example, under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.;Low
Page 1;Accountability – Firms understand their role with regard to the systems they develop or manage, put in place appropriate risk management systems, and share information with other firms as needed to avoid gaps.;High
Page 1;Safety – Systems are subject to risk assessments, and mitigations needed to ensure safe operation are put in place prior to deployment.;High
Page 1;Fairness and Equity – Potential impacts with regard to fairness and equity are assessed and addressed at different phases of development and deployment of the systems.;Medium
Page 1;Transparency – Sufficient information is published to allow consumers to make informed decisions and for experts to evaluate whether risks have been adequately addressed.;High
Page 1;Human Oversight and Monitoring – System use is monitored after deployment, and updates are implemented as needed to address any risks that materialize.;High
Page 1;Validity and Robustness – Systems operate as intended, are secure against cyber attacks, and their behaviour in response to the range of tasks or situations to which they are likely to be exposed is understood.;High
Page 1;Signatories also commit to support the ongoing development of a robust, responsible AI ecosystem in Canada. This includes contributing to the development and application of standards, sharing information and best practices with other members of the AI ecosystem, collaborating with researchers working to advance responsible AI, and collaborating with other actors, including governments, to support public awareness and education on AI.;Medium
Page 1;Signatories also commit to develop and deploy AI systems in a manner that will drive inclusive and sustainable growth in Canada, including by prioritizing human rights, accessibility and environmental sustainability, and to harness the potential of AI to address the most pressing global challenges of our time.;Low
