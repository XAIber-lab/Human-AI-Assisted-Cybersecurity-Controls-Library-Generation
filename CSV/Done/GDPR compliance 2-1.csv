Página: 11 de 49;Exception concerning household activities does not apply to processing controllers or processor who provide the necessary means to process personal data with regard to such activities.
Página: 14 de 49;Both the AI model including in a processing and the processing itself must have the purpose of providing a response to a real need of the entity and the industry. In this paper we are dealing with IA-solutions that exceed the experimental scope and are to be subject to the rules of the market, specifically a regulated market which is obliged to comply with certain quality standards and regulations

Página: 14 de 49;Precision, accuracy or effective error rates of the AI-based solution depending on the appropriate metrics to measure the eligibility of such AI-based solution

Página: 14 de 49;Any technical solution which does not provide a certified answer to those issues cannot be considered a mature technology, but merely a technology without the ability to comply with basic requirements of accountability, transparency and legality.

Página: 15 de 49;Chapter III establishes the rights to which data subjects are entitled, as well as the obligation to guarantee such rights and implement effective mechanisms to exercise such rights, especially the rights to transparency, information, access, rectification, erasure, limitation, opposition, portability, and the rights of citizens with regard to automated decision-making, which is especially relevant when AI solutions are implemented.
Página: 15 de 49;Chapter IV establishes the model of responsibility and compliance based on accountability, and whose governing elements are:
Página: 15 de 49;Identification of an element of responsibility in processing.
Página: 15 de 49;Risk analysis with regard to rights and freedoms.
Página: 15 de 49;Assessment of necessity and proportionality of processing activities considering their goal.
Página: 15 de 49;Deployment of risk management measures, privacy by default and design privacy measures, security measures, incident management, etc.
Página: 15 de 49;Chapter C establishes the conditions to carry out transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations.
Página: 16 de 49;One of the key aspects of the GDPR, which is central to determine whether accountability and transparency policies have been correctly implemented, is to duly identify the different roles and responsibilities within the processing.
Página: 19 de 49;The decision to adopt, in the frame of a processing activity, a technical solution based on AI or other technology, is made by the controller, since it is the controller who "determines the means and purposes of processing", and, therefore, in charge of making the decision of which technological or other solution is to be used. Such controller is obliged to act with due diligence when selecting the most correct solution, particularly when outsourcing or acquiring the relevant development; they shall require and assess any quality specifications of the relevant solution, establish the scope of the processing and take the burden of facing the consequences of their decisions. The person in charge of conducting the processing shall be the person responsible, and they may not claim that they lacked information or technical knowledge to elude their responsibility to audit and decide whether a system is eligible. Transferring the responsibility to the AI system itself is not acceptable in any case.
Página: 19 de 49;Grounds for a legitimate personal data processing (articles 6 to 11 of the GDPR).
Página: 19 de 49;Obligation to inform data subjects and to be transparent in this respect (articles 12 to 14 of the GDPR).
Página: 19 de 49;Obligation to provide data subjects with mechanisms to exercise their rights (articles 15 to 23 of the GDPR).
Página: 19 de 49;Application of the principle of accountability (articles 24 to 43) that establish the need to include a series of additional guarantees, beyond a minimum, documented and oriented to manage the risks posed to the rights and freedoms of individuals); particularly, the obligation to keep a registry of processing activities (article 30 of the GDPR).
Página: 19 de 49;Compliance with all terms and conditions to carry out international data transfers (articles 44 to 50 of the GDPR).
Página: 19 de 49;Establishing a legitimating legal base is the first step that needs to be taken to ensure that the AI-based solution is compliant with the GDPR. Lawfulness the personal data processing has to be considered before the design phase of the processing, regardless of whether such processing consists creating an AI component or to implement an AI component in the processing. From a Data Protection Approach, legitimacy is the first element that needs to be established within the stage of processing design. If no legitimate grounds can be found to proceed with the processing, such processing cannot be carried out.
Página: 20 de 49;It is very important to take into account that the two last legal grounds must be rooted in the legal framework of the European Union or of one of its Member States, which shall ley down the legal grounds for data processing. That is, a private entity may not claim public interest grounds if this is not laid down in a law.
Página: 20 de 49;Another important aspect to be considered is the principle of limited processing. This means that having legal grounds to process data does not authorise to process such data for any purpose and at any time whatsoever. Contrary to that, the relevant processing must be limited to those express, specific and limited purposes that have been identified, and an effort shall be made to avoid any processing which is incompatible to such purposes. Besides, the data subject whose data are to be process must be aware of the uses of such data, which is closely related with the principle of information and transparency.
Página: 20 de 49;Extinction of a legitimating legal grounds, such as the removal of consent, does not have a retroactive effect regarding the results obtained in a processing activity already completed. For example, when personal data have been used to train an AI component, the applicable legal grounds do not invalidate the operation of this model, but the data controller must pay attention to any requests of exercises of rights with regard to data protection.
Página: 20 de 49;If the data controller uses third party data sets for training an AI component, it must act with due diligence for verifying that the original data source is legitimate, including the purchase or service agreement, or the corresponding contractual clauses that claim evidences and commitments of such legitimacy.
