7;AI actors should respect the rule of law, human rights, democratic and human-centred values throughout the AI system lifecycle. These include non-discrimination and equality, freedom, dignity, autonomy of individuals, privacy and data protection, diversity, fairness, social justice, and internationally recognised labour rights.;high
7;AI actors should implement mechanisms and safeguards, such as capacity for human agency and oversight, including to address risks arising from uses outside of intended purpose, intentional misuse, or unintentional misuse in a manner appropriate to the context and consistent with the state of the art;high
8;AI systems should be robust, secure and safe throughout their entire lifecycle so that, in conditions of normal use, foreseeable use or misuse, or other adverse conditions, they function appropriately and do not pose unreasonable safety and/or security risks;high
8;Mechanisms should be in place, as appropriate, to ensure that if AI systems risk causing undue harm or exhibit undesired behaviour, they can be overridden, repaired, and/or decommissioned safely as needed;high
8;Mechanisms should also, where technically feasible, be in place to bolster information integrity while ensuring respect for freedom of expression;medium
8;AI actors should be accountable for the proper functioning of AI systems and for the respect of the above principles, based on their roles, the context, and consistent with the state of the art;high
8;AI actors should ensure traceability, including in relation to datasets, processes and decisions made during the AI system lifecycle, to enable analysis of the AI system's outputs and responses to inquiry, appropriate to the context and consistent with the state of the art;high
8;AI actors, should, based on their roles, the context, and their ability to act, apply a systematic risk management approach to each phase of the AI system lifecycle on an ongoing basis and adopt responsible business conduct to address risks related to AI systems;high
8;AI actors should commit to transparency and responsible disclosure regarding AI systems;high
8;to foster a general understanding of AI systems, including their capabilities and limitations;medium
8;to make stakeholders aware of their interactions with AI systems, including in the workplace;high
8;to provide plain and easy-to-understand information on the sources of data/input, factors, processes and/or logic that led to the prediction, content, recommendation or decision, to enable those affected by an AI system to understand the output;high
8;to provide information that enable those adversely affected by an AI system to challenge its output;high
9;Governments should consider long-term public investment, and encourage private investment, in research and development and open science, including interdisciplinary efforts, to spur innovation in trustworthy AI;medium
9;Governments should also consider public investment and encourage private investment in open-source tools and open datasets that are representative and respect privacy and data protection;medium
9;Governments should promote an agile policy environment that supports transitioning from the research and development stage to the deployment and operation stage for trustworthy AI systems;medium
9;they should consider using experimentation to provide a controlled environment in which AI systems can be tested, and scaled-up, as appropriate;high
9;Governments should review and adapt, as appropriate, their policy and regulatory frameworks and assessment mechanisms as they apply to AI systems to encourage innovation and competition for trustworthy AI;medium
10;Governments should work together in the OECD and other global and regional fora to foster the sharing of AI knowledge;low
10;Governments should promote the development of multi-stakeholder, consensus-driven global technical standards for interoperable and trustworthy AI;medium
10;Governments should encourage the development, and their own use, of internationally comparable indicators to measure AI research, development and deployment, and gather the evidence base to assess progress in the implementation of these principles;medium
