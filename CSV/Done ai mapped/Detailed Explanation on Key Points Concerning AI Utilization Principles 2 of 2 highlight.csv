"In the case of profiling by using AI in fields that might have a significant influence on individual's rights or interests, AI service providers and business users are expected to carefully consider all disadvantages that may occur to the target individuals";green
"Incorrect decisions are made by providing profiling results that are different from the facts";yellow
"An adverse decision can be made on the target individual if a part of his/her profiling results is the same as the characteristics of a particular group and an unfavorable decision is made on the group";yellow
"As a result of profiling, a treatment that impairs the rights and interests of target individuals or groups can occur, which may promote unfair discrimination against individuals or groups";yellow
"Negative decisions can be made in the process of predicting (extrapolating) an uncertain future based on profiling results";yellow
"AI service providers, business users, and data providers should pay attention to the possibility of bias inherent in the judgements of AI systems or AI services, and take into consideration that individuals and groups will not be unfairly discriminated against by their judgments";green
"Take into consideration that AI can be biased due to the failure to ensure representativeness for the data even if the AI learning algorithm is designed to prevent an unfair judgment";green
"Take into consideration that AI can be biased as a result of using data embedding social bias even if sensitive information is not embedded into the data";green
"Take into consideration that the learning data may be affected by the bias of the person who labels (intentionally or unintentionally) because the label for the learning data is often created and granted manually during the preprocessing phase";green
"Respect personal privacy embedded in data in the case of collecting enormous amounts of data, including personal data, to satisfy the representativeness of the data";green
"AI service providers and business users are expected to record and preserve logs, including those on inputs/outputs, to ensure the verifiability of inputs/outputs from an AI";green

"Frequency of log acquisition and recording";yellow
"Log accuracy";yellow
"Log retention period";yellow
"Log protection (Ensuring security, and integrity, etc.)";green
"Capacity of storage location";yellow
"Log time recording";yellow
"Scope of log to be disclosed";yellow
"AI service providers and business users are expected to ensure the explainability of the judgment results by AI for the purpose of ensuring the trust of users and to present evidence of AI behavior with consideration of the social context in case of utilizing AI in a field that has a significant impact on individual's rights and interests";green
"Adopt an interpretable model of AI software with high readability in advance";green
"Adopt technical methods that can explain a black-box model";green
"A global explanation method that replaces the model with an interpretable model, such as a model that makes the AI's prediction and recognition process readable";green
"A local explanation method that presents the basis of prediction for specific input, such as the presentation of key features or the presentation of important learning data and its expression in natural language";green
"Manage when, where, and for what purpose data used for AI learning is collected (data provenance)";green
"Analyze AI judgment trends based on combinations of multiple AI input and output (for example, observe changes in output when the input pattern is changed little by little)";green
"With consideration of the needs and opinions of consumer users, clarify parts in which an explanation is lacking, and collaborate with developers to find out what kind of explanation is necessary";green
"Users should make efforts to fulfill their accountability to stakeholders";green
"Based on the nature and purpose of the AI to be used, they are expected to provide and further explain information on the characteristics of the AI system, and communicate with various stakeholders according to their knowledge and capability";green
"AI service providers and business users are expected to create, publish and disseminate AI usage policies";green
"To create and publish an AI usage policy so that consumer users and third parties are aware of the use of AI when the judgment of an AI could directly affect them, and to provide notifications to them when asked";green
"Use of AI (if specific functions or technologies can be identified, their names and contents)";yellow
"Scope and method of AI utilization";yellow
"Risks associated with AI utilization";green
"Consultation counter";red
"They are expected to publish or notify them not only before use of an AI is started but after its behavior changes or use of it is terminated (especially when assumed risks are changed due to a change in the AI's behavior)";green
