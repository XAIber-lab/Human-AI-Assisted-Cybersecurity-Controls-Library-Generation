"Organizations must ensure the infrastructure is highly scalable and flexible and able to handle increasingly complex AI applications. Strong compute capabilities, network infrastructure, and automation are critical for an AI-ready infrastructure";green
"Data is the critical backbone and lifeblood necessary for AI operations. Beyond ensuring the security and protection of data, organizations must ensure a centrally managed database, integrated AI systems, data hygiene practices, and the proficiency of current analytics tools and their employees";green
"High-quality, diverse, and accessible data is indispensable for AI algorithms. It is critical to understand patterns, recognize anomalies, and provide personalized experiences, making businesses more efficient and competitive";yellow
"The potential of AI to bring about transformative benefits to governments, economies and society is undeniable. However, navigating AI adoption is fraught with risks that demand organizations have a strong framework of policies and protocols in place to guide the ethical and responsible management of data and AI systems";green
"The speed and force of AI's entry into an enterprise should not come at the expense of these policies and protocols. Unchecked, AI presents critical risks including bias, data privacy, unanticipated output, false content, uninformed decision making, and reputational liability";green
"Effective governance is now the inflection point in successful AI implementation, and the new challenge keeping CEOs up at night";red
"If AI is going to reach its full potential, then identifying and addressing bias in data and AI algorithms must be a top priority";green
"Organizations are also not fully prepared to guard against the cybersecurity threats that come with AI adoption. As higher volumes of data, including confidential and sensitive data, is processed by AI, the incentive for malicious actors to launch attacks against these systems becomes greater and the stakes for organizations get higher";green
"The encouraging part is that more than three-quarters (77%) of organizations are at least implementing advanced encryption or end-to-end encryption to protect the data utilized in AI models";red
"AI at its best represents an effective partnership between people and technology, which makes having the right talent for AI integration and deployment a crucial piece of the readiness puzzle";yellow
"The growing adoption of AI is poised to bring about large and fundamental culture changes requiring stakeholder support and receptivity for success";yellow
"When creating a strategic plan for AI adoption, organizations need to prioritize short-term actions like infrastructure development, talent training, and pilot projects, while planning for long-term goals such as scalability, continuous learning, and robust governance";green
"As AI technologies rapidly evolve, it's essential to remain strategically adaptable. Regular evaluation of AI initiatives, integration with other technologies, and staying abreast of advancements should be part of a periodic strategic review of AI deployment and maturity to ensure the organization reaps maximum benefits while addressing potential risks";green
"Organizations will need to find the balance between meeting increased power consumption needs and delivering on their sustainability commitments";yellow
"This is where their adoption of technologies that help deliver more output while consuming less power will become a competitive differentiator as adoption of AI increases";red
"To remove data silos in an organization implementing AI, it's essential first to conduct a comprehensive audit of existing data repositories to understand their structure and interconnections";green
"Organizations need to implement a centralized data management system or platform that promotes data integration, uniformity, and accessibility across departments";green
"Organizations need to foster a collaborative culture, supported by clear policies and continuous training, to ensure consistent data practices and encourage cross-departmental data sharing and usage";green
"Organizations should train everyone to understand the power of AI to use it to their advantage and augment their workflows. Doing so can help foster acceptance of AI as an enabler rather than a threat to job security and help integrate AI seamlessly into the fabric of an organization";green
"The organization's leaders need to ensure that new AI deployments are inclusive and can be used by employees with differing abilities across teams, and that all levels of the organization are prepared for and highly engaged with the changes AI adoption will bring";green
"When implementing AI at scale, change management must have a people focus, ensuring open dialogue to address apprehensions and illustrate how AI can complement human roles rather than replace them";green
"The change management plan demands comprehensive upskilling and continuous education programs to empower employees to work synergistically with advanced AI systems";green
"Fostering an equitable, accessible, and inclusive environment where feedback is actively sought can help adapt strategies to employees' evolving needs and will be critical to promoting a smooth transition and sustained adoption of AI technologies";green
"Companies deploying AI may need internal policies that address data privacy and security and ethical use of AI technology";green
"They should also implement robust cybersecurity measures considering the potential vulnerabilities introduced by AI systems";green
"Guidelines on continuous training and upskilling can ensure that employees remain competent and confident in an AI-augmented environment";green
"For Infrastructure readiness, 95% of respondents recognize that AI will increase infrastructure workloads. The demands will surge on almost every aspect of infrastructure needed not just to deploy AI but also leverage its full potential";yellow
"Looking at the Data pillar, the largest immediate issue is data centralization, with 81% of respondents admitting that their data exists in silos across their organizations. This lack of centralization presents considerable risks for data and AI management";green
"Consistently pre-processing and cleaning data to eliminate structural errors and maintain its quality for AI applications";green
"Around three quarters (76%) of global respondents are conducting advanced and intermediate level external data quality checks, to ensure the reliability of it for AI training";yellow
"AI bias can occur for a variety of reasons, including the data itself being biased because it hasn't been checked and pre-processed, or because humans, often unwittingly influenced by inherent and often subconscious biases, choose the data, define the algorithm, and decide how the outcomes of the algorithms are used";yellow
