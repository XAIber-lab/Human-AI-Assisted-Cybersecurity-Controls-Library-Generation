1_As part of your obligation to implement data protection by design and by default, you should consider statistical accuracy and the appropriate measures to evaluate it from the design phase and test these measures throughout the AI lifecycle. After deployment, you should implement monitoring, the frequency of which should be proportional to the impact an incorrect output may have on individuals. The higher the impact the more frequently you should monitor and report on it._DE.CM-09_ID.RA-05_DE.AE-04_data protection_High_no
1_You should also review your statistical accuracy measures regularly to mitigate the risk of concept drift. Your change policy procedures should take this into account from the outset._GV.RM-02_ID.RA-07_PR.IR-03__Medium_no
1_Finally, the vast quantity of personal data you may hold and process as part of your AI systems is likely to put pressure on any pre-existing non-AI processes you use to identify and, if necessary, rectify/delete inaccurate personal data, whether it is used as input or training/test data. Therefore, you need to review your data governance practices and systems to ensure they remain fit for purpose._PR.DS-01; PR.DS-02_ID.AM-07_GV.PO-02_data protection_High_no
1_Statistical accuracy is also an important consideration if you outsource the development of an AI system to a third party (either fully or partially) or purchase an AI solution from an external vendor. In these cases, you should examine and test any claims made by third parties as part of the procurement process._GV.SC-06_ID.RA-09_GV.SC-07__High_no
3_You should take into account a variety of possible effects when considering impact, from material to non-material harm. This includes emotional consequences such as distress, and any significant economic or social disadvantage._ID.RA-04_ID.RA-05_DE.AE-04__High_no
4_Data protection by design and by default requires you to consider data protection issues at the design stage of your processing activities, and throughout the AI lifecycle._GV.PO-01_PR.PS-06_PR.DS-01_data protection_High_no
4_It is about putting in place technical and organisational measures to: implement the data protection principles effectively; and integrate necessary safeguards into your processing._PR.DS-01; PR.DS-02_PR.PS-01_GV.PO-01_data protection_High_no
4_AI increases the importance of embedding a data protection by design approach into your organisation's culture and processes._GV.RR-01_PR.AT-01_GV.PO-01_data protection_Medium_no
5_DPIAs require you to consider the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals, including the potential for any significant social or economic disadvantage. The focus is on the potential for harm to individuals or society at large, whether it is physical, material or non-material._ID.RA-04; ID.RA-05_GV.RM-06_DE.AE-04__High_no
5_DPIAs require you to assess and demonstrate how and why: your processing is necessary to achieve your purpose; and the way you go about your processing is a proportionate way of achieving it._ID.RA-06_GV.RM-01_GV.OC-01__High_no
5_Documenting the choices you make in the design of your AI system, alongside your assessment of the risks it poses, also helps you demonstrate that your processing is fair. DPIAs help you address AI risks if you see them as not just a box-ticking compliance exercise, but as an ongoing process, subject to regular review._ID.RA-07_GV.OV-03_ID.IM-01__High_no
6_Transparency is about being clear, open and honest with individuals from the start about who you are, as well as why and how you want to process their data. This enables them to make an informed choice about whether they wish to enter into a relationship with you, or try and negotiate its terms._GV.OC-02_RS.CO-02_GV.RM-05_transparency_High_yes
6_Your senior management should be responsible for signing-off the chosen approach to manage discrimination risk and be accountable for its compliance with data protection law._GV.RR-01_GV.RR-02_GV.OV-03__High_no
8_The data minimisation principle is about only collecting the personal data you need to achieve your purpose. The storage limitation principle is about keeping that data only for as long as you need it._PR.DS-01_ID.AM-07_GV.PO-01_data protection_High_yes
8_The security principle requires you to protect the data you hold from unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage._PR.DS-01; PR.DS-02_PR.PS-01_PR.IR-01__High_yes
8_Simply removing particular attributes to mitigate the risk of discrimination will not necessarily achieve the intended outcome._ID.RA-04_ID.RA-05_GV.RM-06__Medium_no
9_Failure to allocate accountability appropriately between processors and controllers can lead to non-compliance with the fairness principle. Accountability gaps can lead to unjustifiably adverse effects for individuals or undermine their ability to exercise rights._GV.RR-02_GV.SC-02_GV.RR-01__High_no
10_Individuals have a number of rights relating to their personal data. These enable them to exercise control over that data by scrutinising your processing, and in some cases challenging it. For example, by exercising rights such as erasure, restriction and objection._PR.AA-05_GV.OC-03_PR.DS-01__High_yes
11_In AI, these rights apply wherever you use personal data at any point in the AI lifecycle and are important for fairness._GV.OC-03_PR.AA-05_GV.PO-01__High_no
11_This is the case even when you are using a partly automated decision-making process that involves AI. Thinking about how you will tell individuals about how your system will use their data to train or contribute through its recommendations to decisions, will also make you think more carefully about its impact and consequences on them._GV.OC-02_RS.CO-02_PR.AA-05__High_no
31_From a technological perspective, AI systems introduce new kinds of complexity not found in more traditional IT systems that you may be used to using._GV.OC-01_ID.AM-02_ID.RA-04__Medium_yes
31_your existing systems need to be integrated with several other new and existing IT components, which are also intricately connected._PR.IR-03_ID.AM-02_PR.PS-01__Medium_no
31_Since AI systems operate as part of a larger chain of software components, data flows, organisational workflows and business processes, you should take a holistic approach to security._PR.PS-01_GV.SC-09_PR.IR-03__High_no
